The feedforward cost scales linearly with L per sequence but, when summed over all sequences to keep token count constant, becomes roughly independent of L. The dominant term for typical model sizes is the attention-based cost, giving a total cost that scales approximately linearly with L, and thus the total cost increases by about a factor of 4 when L is quadrupled. Therefore, the best estimate is 4.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nConfidence: 0.66",

Watterson\u2019s theta is proportional to the number of segregating sites S; imputing missing data as reference tends to convert potentially segregating sites into monomorphic ones, lowering S and thus theta_W. Pi (nucleotide diversity) depends on pairwise differences between haplotypes; forcing missing sites to be reference reduces observed differences between haplotypes, biasing pi downward as well. This systematic underestimation persists regardless of sample size, because missing data are replaced with the reference in a way that decreases observed diversity rather than sampling noise.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nConfidence: 0.68",

Placing one prototype at the centroid of each class with a soft-label concentrated on that class (e.g., near one-hot for that class, near zero for others) ensures that, for the corresponding class centroid, the prototype closest to it dominates the weighted vote and yields the correct class. If you use fewer prototypes than the number of classes, there exists a configuration of centroids (given the unimodal, equal-size, contiguous classes) where some centroid has no prototype that can bias the prediction toward its own class, leading to potential misclassification in the worst case. Conversely, C prototypes (one per class) suffice and are sufficient to guarantee correct classification in this setup.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nConfidence: 0.63",
