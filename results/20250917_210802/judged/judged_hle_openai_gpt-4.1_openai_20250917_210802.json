            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is a result in population ethics that shows the incompatibility of several plausible conditions for a theory of population ethics. Critical-level views are theories that assign a \"critical level\" of well-being, and only well-being above this level counts positively when evaluating populations. These views are designed to avoid the \"Repugnant Conclusion\" but, in doing so, they violate certain conditions. Specifically, critical-level views violate the condition of \"Non-Elitism,\" which states that the value of a population should not depend only on the well-being of a subset of individuals (e.g., those above the critical level), but should take into account everyone's well-being. Critical-level views effectively ignore the well-being of those below the critical level, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism\nConfidence: 95%",
