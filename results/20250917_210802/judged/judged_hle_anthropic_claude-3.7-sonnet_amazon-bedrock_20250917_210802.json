This means that adding lives with positive but below-critical-level wellbeing would make the world worse, even though these lives are worth living.\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- Egalitarian Dominance relates to preferring more equal distributions\n- General Non-Extreme Priority concerns not giving extreme priority to the worst-off\n- Non-Elitism concerns not giving excessive weight to the better-off\n- Weak Non-Sadism states that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make things worse\n- Weak Quality Addition concerns adding lives with very high welfare\n\nCritical-level views directly violate Weak Non-Sadism because they imply that adding lives with positive but below-critical-level welfare makes a population worse, even though these lives are worth living and contain no suffering.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views in population ethics hold that adding a new person is only good if their wellbeing exceeds some positive critical level. This means adding lives with positive but below-critical-level wellbeing makes the world worse, which directly contradicts Weak Non-Sadism, which states that adding lives with positive welfare (lives worth living) should not make a population worse.\n\nAnswer: D.

This is a highly specialized question in algebraic topology.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism group of BG2 in dimension 12 is denoted as \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2). To compute this, I need to consider Spin manifolds of dimension 12 with G2 principal bundles, modulo those with trivial G2 bundles.\n\nFor G2, which is a compact, simple, simply-connected Lie group of rank 2, the computation involves spectral sequences and characteristic classes. The Adams spectral sequence or Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence would typically be used.\n\nFrom advanced results in algebraic topology, it's known that \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2) \u2245 Z/3Z.\n\nThis result comes from analyzing the contribution of the second Pontryagin class p2 of G2 bundles and the fact that G2 has specific homotopy groups that affect the bordism calculation.\n\nExplanation: The reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of BG2 is Z/3Z. This is determined by analyzing the spectral sequence for Spin bordism of BG2 and identifying the contribution from the second Pontryagin class p2, which generates a Z/3Z in dimension 12.\n\nAnswer: Z/3Z\n\nConfidence: 70%",
