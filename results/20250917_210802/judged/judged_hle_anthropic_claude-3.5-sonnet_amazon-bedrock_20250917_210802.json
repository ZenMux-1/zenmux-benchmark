            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should make a population better. However, critical-level views hold that adding lives is only good if they exceed some critical level of welfare, even if those lives are worth living. This directly conflicts with Weak Quality Addition, which suggests that adding lives with positive welfare (even if below the critical level) should improve the overall value of a population.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 90%",
