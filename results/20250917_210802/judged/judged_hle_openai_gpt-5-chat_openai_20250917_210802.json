            "response": "We are asked to compute the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism of \\(BG_2\\). Let me carefully parse what this means.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1. General framework\nWe want \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\). \n\nBy standard methods, Spin-bordism with coefficients in a space \\(X\\) is computed by the Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS):\n\\[\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(X; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_q) \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{p+q}(X).\n\\]\n\nThe \"reduced\" version means we should quotient out the subgroup that comes from \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_*(\\mathrm{pt})\\), i.e. the classes represented by trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles. So we are effectively interested in the reduced groups.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2. Spin bordism of a point\nWe need \\(\\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}}\\) for \\(q\\le 12\\). The known structure (stably) is that \\(\\Omega_*^{\\text{Spin}}\\) agrees with \\(ko_*\\) in low degrees. Explicitly,\n\n- \\(\\Omega_0^{\\text{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- For \\(q=1,2,3\\): \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2, \\mathbb{Z}/2, 0\\).\n- \\(q=4\\): \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(q=5,6,7\\): 0.\n- \\(q=8: \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(q=9: \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\).\n- \\(q=10: \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\).\n- \\(q=11: 0\\).\n- \\(q=12: \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nThis is the standard computation (from Stong, Anderson\u2013Brown\u2013Peterson, etc).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3. Cohomology of \\(BG_2\\)\nWe now need information about \\(H^*(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z})\\). Since \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, exceptional Lie group. \\(BG_2\\) has cohomology ring (integrally) polynomial on generators in degrees 4 and 12. Namely\n\\[\nH^*(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n\\]\nwith \\(|x_4|=4\\), \\(|x_{12}|=12\\). (There is also torsion? But in fact \\(H^*(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z})\\) has **no torsion**, it is a polynomial algebra with those two generators.)\n\nSimilarly, \\(H_*(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z})\\) is free, generated dually in degrees multiple of 4 and 12.\n\nThus in particular:\n- \\(H_{4}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(H_{12}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\) (corresponding to the \\(x_{12}\\) and \\(x_{4}^3\\) monomials).\n- No torsion homology.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4. Assemble AHSS terms\nWe want total degree \\(12\\). So possibilities are \\(p+q=12\\).\n- \\(q=0\\): \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_0) = H_{12}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2.\\)\n- \\(q=4\\): \\(H_8(BG_2;\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_4)\\). Here \\(\\Omega_4^{\\text{Spin}}=\\mathbb{Z}\\). And \\(H_8(BG_2)\\) is generated by \\((x_4^2)\\), so rank 1: \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(q=8\\): \\(H_4(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_8)\\). Here \\(\\Omega_8^{\\text{Spin}}=\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\). Times \\(H_4(BG_2)=\\mathbb{Z}\\). So we get \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(q=12\\): \\(H_0(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nOther possibilities: (p,q) = (\u2026)\n- \\(q=1,2\\): there are \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\) coefficients, but \\(H_{10}, H_{11}\\) are free abelian, but checking: \\(H_{10}(BG_2)\\)? Degree 10 cannot be made from 4 and 12 monomials, correct. Similarly no odd homology degree. So vanish.\n- \\(q=9,10\\): coefficient groups are \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\). Then \\(H_{3}, H_{2}\\) with \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\). But \\(H_2,H_3\\) vanish. So nothing.\n\nSo the only contributions are free abelian ones listed.\n\nSo potentially, at the \\(E^2\\) page:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^2.\n\\]\nThat would be \\(\\mathbb{Z}^7\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5. Differentiels and extensions\nThere may be differentials in AHSS. But note all homology of \\(BG_2\\) is in even degrees, and the coefficients vanish except in even degrees, so no room for differentials: the \\(d_r\\) differentials involve moving to odd-degree homology groups, but they vanish because homology only in multiples of 4 + 12. So no nonzero differentials. Similarly, the groups are all free abelian, so no extension ambiguity. So the spectral sequence collapses.\n\nTherefore:\n\\[\n\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^7.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 6. Reduced bordism\nNow, reduced means we kill the image of \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt})\\), which is \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), embedded as the \\((p=0, q=12)\\) summand. So we subtract those two components. Then we are left with\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Result\nThus the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of \\(BG_2\\) is free abelian of rank 5.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation:** We used the Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequence with \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\), worked out which terms contribute up to degree 12, observed the collapse (no differentials possible, no torsion in \\(H_*(BG_2)\\)), and then subtracted the unreduced part. The outcome is \\(\\mathbb{Z}^5\\).\n\n---\n\nAnswer: \\(\\;\\; \\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\;\\cong\\; \\mathbb{Z}^{5}.\\)\n\nConfidence: 95%",
