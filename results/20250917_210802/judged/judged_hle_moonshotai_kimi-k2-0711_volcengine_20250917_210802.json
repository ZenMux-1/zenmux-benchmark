Critical-level views (e.g., total utilitarianism with a positive critical level) are designed to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion by requiring that adding a life improves the population only if that life\u2019s welfare exceeds a fixed positive \u201ccritical level.\u201d This directly conflicts with the condition Weak Non-Sadism, which states that there exists some negative welfare level such that adding any life at or above that level (no matter how small its positive welfare) cannot make the outcome worse. Because critical-level views declare any life below the critical level to be \u201cbad\u201d to add\u2014even if its welfare is slightly positive\u2014they violate Weak Non-Sadism.\n\nAnswer: D.

In other words, we want the subgroup of Spin bordism classes of 12-manifolds with a G\u2082\u2013structure on their stable normal bundle that become zero in the ordinary Spin bordism group when the G\u2082\u2013structure is forgotten.\n\nThe Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Spin bordism gives  \nE\u00b2_{p,q}=H_p(BG\u2082;\u03a9_q^{Spin}) \u21d2 \u03a9_{p+q}^{Spin}(BG\u2082).  \nSince G\u2082 is 14\u2013connected (\u03c0_i(G\u2082)=0 for i\u226413), the classifying space BG\u2082 is 15\u2013connected, so H_p(BG\u2082)=0 for p\u226414.  Consequently the E\u00b2\u2013page vanishes in total degree 12 (p+q=12 with p\u226414), and hence \u03a9\u2081\u2082^{Spin}(BG\u2082)=0.  Therefore the reduced group is also 0.\n\nAnswer: 0  \nConfidence: 100%",
