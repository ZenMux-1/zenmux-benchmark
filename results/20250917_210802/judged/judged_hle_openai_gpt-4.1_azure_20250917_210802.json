This means that only lives above a certain threshold count positively, which can lead to situations where the interests of a small group (those above the critical level) dominate the evaluation, potentially ignoring the interests of others. This violates the condition of \"Non-Elitism,\" which requires that no particular group\u2019s interests should dominate the assessment. Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem identifies that critical-level views violate Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 95%",
