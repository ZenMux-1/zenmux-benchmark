            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above some critical level should make a population better, all else being equal. Critical-level views posit that there is some positive welfare level above zero below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives are worth living. This directly conflicts with the Weak Quality Addition condition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare (even if relatively low) should be an improvement.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",
