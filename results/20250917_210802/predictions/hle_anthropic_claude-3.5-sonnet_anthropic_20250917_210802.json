            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should make a population better. Critical-level views hold that adding lives is only good if they exceed some critical level of welfare, which can lead to counterintuitive results where adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare makes a population worse. This directly conflicts with the Weak Quality Addition principle, which says that adding lives with positive welfare should be an improvement.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",
