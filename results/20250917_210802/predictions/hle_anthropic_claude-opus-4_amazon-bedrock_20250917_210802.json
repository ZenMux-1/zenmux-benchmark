            "response": "I need to recall Arrhenius's impossibility theorem and specifically identify which condition critical-level views violate.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that no population axiology can satisfy all of several seemingly reasonable conditions simultaneously. Critical-level views are those that evaluate populations based on how individual welfare compares to some critical level - only lives above this critical level contribute positively to the value of a population.\n\nLet me consider each condition:\n\nA. Egalitarian Dominance - This requires that equal distributions are better than unequal ones under certain conditions.\n\nB. General Non-Extreme Priority - This is about giving priority to worse-off individuals but not to an extreme degree.\n\nC. Non-Elitism - This condition states that adding lives barely worth living to a population cannot make things worse, provided these lives don't affect the original population negatively.\n\nD. Weak Non-Sadism - This prevents certain additions of lives with negative welfare from improving a population.\n\nE. Weak Quality Addition - This condition states that adding lives with sufficiently high welfare should make a population better.\n\nCritical-level views specifically violate Weak Quality Addition. This is because under critical-level views, adding lives that are worth living but below the critical level actually makes the population worse, even if these lives have positive welfare. This directly contradicts Weak Quality Addition, which requires that adding lives with sufficiently high positive welfare should improve the population.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition because they assign negative contributory value to lives that are worth living but fall below the critical level. This means that adding lives with positive welfare can make a population worse if that welfare is below the critical threshold, which directly contradicts the Weak Quality Addition condition that requires adding lives with sufficiently high welfare to improve the population.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",
