            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines several conditions that a social welfare function cannot satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views are a type of population axiology that assign a \"critical level\" of welfare, above which adding individuals is good and below which it is not. These views are known to violate the condition of Non-Elitism, which states that the welfare of a single individual should not dominate the social preference regardless of the number of others. Critical-level views can give disproportionate weight to individuals at or above the critical level, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 85%",

            "response": "Explanation:  \nWe want to compute the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\), denoted \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\). Here, \"reduced\" means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle, i.e., we consider only bordism classes that come from nontrivial principal \\(G_2\\)-bundles.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional closed Spin manifolds \\(M^{12}\\) equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle \\(P \\to M\\), up to Spin bordism with \\(G_2\\)-structure.\n- The reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\(pt \\to BG_2\\), i.e., it ignores classes coming from manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts about \\(G_2\\) and its classifying space**\n\n- \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, exceptional Lie group of dimension 14.\n- The cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is known to be a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n  \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are characteristic classes associated to the \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n- The class \\(x_4\\) corresponds to the first Pontryagin class of the associated 7-dimensional vector bundle (the fundamental representation of \\(G_2\\) is 7-dimensional).\n- The class \\(x_{12}\\) is a higher characteristic class.\n\n**Step 3: Spin bordism and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) are known and have no torsion in dimension 12:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n  generated by certain characteristic numbers (e.g., \\(\\hat{A}\\)-genus and signature-related invariants).\n- The AHSS for \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) has \\(E_2\\)-page:\n  \\[\n  E_2^{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\n  \\]\n  converging to \\(\\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\).\n\n**Step 4: Computing the relevant terms**\n\n- Since \\(BG_2\\) has cohomology only in degrees multiples of 4, and \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) is known, the AHSS collapses in low degrees.\n- The reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) corresponds to the part of \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) that is not in the image of \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt)\\).\n- The nontrivial classes come from the characteristic classes \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\).\n\n**Step 5: Using the Thom isomorphism and characteristic numbers**\n\n- The principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle corresponds to a rank 7 vector bundle with structure group \\(G_2\\).\n- The characteristic classes \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) can be paired with the fundamental class of the manifold to produce characteristic numbers.\n- In dimension 12, the possible characteristic numbers involving \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are:\n  - \\(x_{12}\\) evaluated on the fundamental class.\n  - \\(x_4^3\\) evaluated on the fundamental class (since \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)).\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\n- The reduced Spin bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is generated by these characteristic numbers.\n- Since \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are independent generators, and \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) is torsion-free, the reduced bordism group is free abelian of rank 2.\n- Therefore,\n  \\[\n  \\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}.\n  \\]\n\nAnswer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}.\n}\n\\]\n\nConfidence: 90%",
