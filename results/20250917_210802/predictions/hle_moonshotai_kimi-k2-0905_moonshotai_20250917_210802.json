Thus WQA is violated.  \nNone of the other listed conditions (Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism) are necessarily violated by critical-level views.\n\nAnswer: E.

For the classifying space BG\u2082 we therefore want the subgroup of 12-dimensional Spin-bordism classes that cannot be detected on a closed 12-manifold with trivial G\u2082-bundle, i.e. the subgroup  \n\u03a9\u0303^Spin\u2081\u2082(BG\u2082) := ker[ \u03a9^Spin\u2081\u2082(BG\u2082) \u2192 \u03a9^Spin\u2081\u2082 ].  \n\nBecause G\u2082 is 1-connected and \u03c0\u2082(G\u2082)=0, the first two homotopy groups of BG\u2082 vanish.  Hence the Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Spin bordism collapses in low degrees and there are no differentials that can kill the 12-dimensional line.  The edge homomorphism  \n\u03a9\u0303^Spin\u2081\u2082(BG\u2082) \u2192 H\u2081\u2082(BG\u2082; \u2124)  \nis therefore an isomorphism (torsion in both groups is identified by the AHSS).  \n\nThe integral homology of BG\u2082 in degree 12 is known to be  \nH\u2081\u2082(BG\u2082; \u2124) \u2245 \u2124 \u2295 \u2124/2.  \n\nConsequently the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group is also \u2124 \u2295 \u2124/2.\n\nAnswer: \u2124 \u2295 \u2124/2  \nConfidence: 95 %",
