            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines several conditions that a social welfare function cannot satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views are a type of population axiology that set a \"critical level\" of welfare, above which adding individuals is good and below which it is bad. These views are known to violate the condition of Non-Elitism, which states that the welfare of a single individual should not dominate the social preference regardless of the population size. Critical-level views can give disproportionate weight to individuals at or above the critical level, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 85%",

            "response": "Explanation:  \nWe want to compute the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\), denoted \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\). The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional Spin manifolds equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, up to Spin bordism.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\(BG_2 \\to *\\), i.e., it measures the new bordism classes that arise from nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts about Spin bordism**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) are known and have been computed by Anderson-Brown-Peterson.\n- In dimension 12, \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\), generated by certain characteristic numbers (e.g., \\(\\hat{A}\\)-genus and other invariants).\n\n**Step 3: Cohomology and characteristic classes of \\(BG_2\\)**\n\n- \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, exceptional Lie group of rank 2.\n- The integral cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is known to be a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n  \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) correspond to characteristic classes associated to the \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n- The class \\(x_4\\) is related to the first Pontryagin class \\(p_1\\) of the associated vector bundle (the 7-dimensional representation of \\(G_2\\)).\n\n**Step 4: Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)**\n\n- To compute \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\), use the AHSS:\n  \\[\n  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n  \\]\n- Since \\(BG_2\\) has no homology in odd degrees (it is simply connected and has polynomial cohomology in even degrees), the AHSS collapses at \\(E^2\\) modulo extension problems.\n- The relevant terms for total degree 12 are:\n  - \\(H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\)\n  - \\(H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\)\n  - \\(H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\)\n  - \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\)\n\n**Step 5: Spin bordism groups in low degrees**\n\n- \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\) (generated by K3 or \\(\\mathbb{HP}^1\\))\n- \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\) (generated by products of 4-manifolds or the Bott manifold)\n- \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\n\n**Step 6: Homology of \\(BG_2\\)**\n\n- By universal coefficients and Poincar\u00e9 duality for \\(BG_2\\) (which is infinite-dimensional but behaves like a classifying space with polynomial cohomology), the homology groups are:\n  - \\(H_0(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\) (dual to \\(x_4\\))\n  - \\(H_8(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\) (generated by \\(x_4^2\\))\n  - \\(H_{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\) (generated by \\(x_{12}\\))\n\n**Step 7: Compute the \\(E^2\\)-page terms**\n\n- \\(E^2_{0,12} = H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\n- \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\n**Step 8: Extensions and differentials**\n\n- Since \\(BG_2\\) is simply connected and the AHSS is concentrated in even degrees, differentials vanish for degree reasons.\n- The spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\).\n- The total group is an extension of these groups:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\oplus H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\oplus H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\oplus H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}).\n  \\]\n\n**Step 9: Reduced bordism**\n\n- The reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}.\n  \\]\n- This map corresponds to the projection onto the \\(E^2_{0,12}\\) term.\n- Therefore,\n  \\[\n  \\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\oplus H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\oplus H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}).\n  \\]\n- Substituting the groups:\n  \\[\n  \\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}^4.\n  \\]\n\n**Step 10: Interpretation**\n\n- The reduced Spin bordism group in dimension 12 for \\(BG_2\\) is free abelian of rank 4.\n- The generators correspond to:\n  - \\(H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\): classes obtained by pulling back the degree 4 class \\(x_4\\) and pairing with 8-dimensional Spin manifolds.\n  - \\(H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\): classes from \\(x_4^2\\) paired with 4-dimensional Spin manifolds.\n  - \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\): classes from \\(x_{12}\\) paired with points.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nAnswer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^4.\n}\n\\]\n\nConfidence: 95%  \n(The computation relies on standard spectral sequence arguments and known cohomology of \\(BG_2\\).
