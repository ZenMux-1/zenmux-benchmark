            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's impossibility theorems in population ethics explore the challenges in creating a moral theory that satisfies several intuitive conditions simultaneously. Critical-level views in population ethics suggest that there is a certain level of well-being below which lives do not add positive value to the world. This view can conflict with certain conditions in Arrhenius's theorems. Specifically, critical-level views can violate the condition of \"Weak Quality Addition,\" which suggests that adding individuals with lives worth living should not make an outcome worse. Critical-level views imply that adding lives below a certain threshold does not improve the outcome, potentially violating this condition.\n\nAnswer: E. Weak Quality Addition\nConfidence: 85%",

Its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) is a space such that principal \\( G_2 \\)-bundles over a manifold \\( M \\) correspond to homotopy classes of maps from \\( M \\) to \\( BG_2 \\).\n\nThe Spin bordism group \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_n(BG_2)\\) classifies \\( n \\)-dimensional Spin manifolds with a map to \\( BG_2 \\). The \"reduced\" bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_n(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_n(BG_2) \\to \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_n\\), which forgets the map to \\( BG_2 \\).\n\nFor \\( n = 12 \\), we are interested in \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\). The computation of this group involves understanding the homotopy groups of \\( BG_2 \\) and the action of the Steenrod algebra on the cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\).\n\nThe cohomology ring \\( H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is known to be a polynomial ring generated by classes in degrees 4 and 6. The relevant characteristic classes for Spin bordism are the Stiefel-Whitney and Pontryagin classes, which can be expressed in terms of these generators.\n\nThe Adams spectral sequence is a tool that can be used to compute the Spin bordism groups. The \\( E_2 \\)-term of this spectral sequence is given by the Ext groups over the Steenrod algebra, and it converges to the stable homotopy groups of spheres, which are related to the bordism groups.\n\nIn particular, the reduced Spin bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is related to the image of the J-homomorphism and the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The image of the J-homomorphism in dimension 12 is known to be \\(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nTherefore, the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism group of \\( BG_2 \\) is \\(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nExplanation: The computation involves understanding the structure of \\( BG_2 \\), the relevant characteristic classes, and the use of the Adams spectral sequence. The result is related to the image of the J-homomorphism in stable homotopy theory.\n\nAnswer: \\(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}\\)\nConfidence: 85%",
