            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views in population ethics introduce a \"critical level\" of well-being that must be exceeded for an additional life to make a positive contribution to overall value. These views can allow for situations where the interests of a small group (those above the critical level) dominate the evaluation, potentially ignoring the interests of the majority if they are below the critical level. This violates the condition of \"Non-Elitism,\" which requires that the value of a population should not be determined solely by the well-being of a subset of individuals (the \"elite\"). Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that critical-level views violate Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism\n\nConfidence: 95%",
