            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should make a population better. However, critical-level views hold that adding lives is only good if they exceed some critical level of welfare, even if those lives have positive welfare. This directly contradicts the Weak Quality Addition condition, which says that adding lives with positive welfare (even if below the critical level) should improve the population.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 90%",
