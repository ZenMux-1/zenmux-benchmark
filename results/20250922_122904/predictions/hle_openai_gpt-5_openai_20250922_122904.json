The map SL_2(R) \u2192 X is a regular covering with deck group SL_2(Z). Hence there is an exact sequence of fundamental groups\n1 \u2192 \u03c01(SL_2(R)) \u2192 \u03c01(X) \u2192 SL_2(Z) \u2192 1.\nConjugation by elements of SL_2(R) is homotopic to the identity (since SL_2(R) is connected), so the induced action on \u03c01(SL_2(R)) is trivial. Passing to abelianizations (i.e., H_1 with Z-coefficients) gives a short exact sequence that splits:\n0 \u2192 H_1(SL_2(R), Z) \u2192 H_1(X, Z) \u2192 H_1(SL_2(Z), Z) \u2192 0,\nand because the action is trivial this yields a direct sum\nH_1(X, Z) \u2245 H_1(SL_2(R), Z) \u2295 H_1(SL_2(Z), Z).\nNow SL_2(R) deformation retracts onto its maximal compact subgroup SO(2), so H_1(SL_2(R), Z) \u2245 H_1(SO(2), Z) \u2245 Z. It is a classical fact that H_1(SL_2(Z), Z) \u2245 Z/12Z (e.g., from the presentation of SL_2(Z), or via PSL_2(Z)ab \u2245 Z/6Z and the central extension by \u00b1I).

Hence in any such orthogonal basis all ab matrices must be rank 1, so the only admissible k is k=ab. Therefore all integers 0,1,\u2026,ab\u22121 are not admissible: that is ab non-admissible integers.\n\n- If min(a,b)\u22652, we can realize any k\u2208{0,\u2026,ab}. Start from the standard orthonormal basis {E_{ij}} of rank-1 matrices (so k=ab is admissible). To decrease the rank-1 count by 2, pick two basis elements E_{i1 j1}, E_{i2 j2} with i1\u2260i2 and j1\u2260j2 and replace them by (E_{i1 j1}\u00b1E_{i2 j2})/\u221a2; both new matrices have rank 2 and remain orthonormal to the rest. Once we have at least one non\u2013rank-1 matrix H, we can decrease the count by 1 at a time by rotating within the 2D subspace spanned by H and any remaining rank-1 matrix R: for a generic unitary 2\u00d72 rotation of {H,R}, both resulting matrices have rank \u22652 while orthogonality to the rest is preserved. Iterating these steps yields an orthogonal basis with exactly any prescribed number k of rank-1 elements, including k=0. Hence all k in 0,\u2026,ab are admissible, so there are no non-admissible integers.\n\nAnswer: 0 if min(a,b)\u22652; otherwise ab.\n\nConfidence: 92%",

Hence \u03b2 must be a 5-cycle with two fixed points. Fix \u03b2 = (1 2 3 4 5)(6)(7). Two pairs (\u03b1, \u03b2) up to S7-conjugacy correspond to \u03b1 up to conjugation by the centralizer C(\u03b2) \u2245 C5 \u00d7 C2 (rotations of the 5-cycle and the swap (6 7)).\n\nTransitivity is equivalent to connectedness of the Schreier graph: thus \u03b1 must connect both fixed points 6 and 7 into the 5-cycle orbit.

Up to C(\u03b2), the pair {i, j} is classified by whether i and j are adjacent on the 5-cycle (an edge) or nonadjacent (a diagonal): 2 possibilities.\n\n- If \u03b1 has exactly two transpositions: two C(\u03b2)-orbits (edge vs diagonal).\n- If \u03b1 has three transpositions: after fixing {i, j} (edge or diagonal), there are three inequivalent choices for the extra transposition among the remaining three vertices. This yields 3 orbits in the edge case and 3 in the diagonal case.\n\nTotal number of C(\u03b2)-orbits of \u03b1 giving transitive actions is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8, hence 8 subgroups of index 7.\n\nAnswer: 8\nConfidence: 86%",

Repeating with fresh randomness does not help: for any candidate s', one can pick a2 = (s' \u2212 (2y1 \u2212 y2)) / 2 to make the same shares, and then choose a1 accordingly.

Multiples of 3 do nothing, so only divisors not divisible by 3 matter. Let t be r with all factors of 3 removed (the largest divisor of r not divisible by 3). The last nontrivial action comes from the largest divisor not divisible by 3, which is t. Therefore:\n- If t \u2261 1 (mod 3): final is red (last action is a reset).\n- If t \u2261 2 (mod 3): final is blue iff the number of divisors of t that are \u2261 2 (mod 3) and exceed the largest \u2261 1 (mod 3) divisor is odd.\n\nEquivalently, let p be the smallest prime divisor of t with p \u2261 2 (mod 3). Then the number of divisors of t exceeding t/p equals the number of divisors of t that are < p. For even t (p=2), that count is 1 (only the divisor 1), so every even t gives blue. For odd t \u2264 100 with t \u2261 2 (mod 3), all give blue except t=77=7\u00b711: here p=11 and the divisors < 11 are {1,7} (two of them), yielding red.

For the last layer, d_3 = 10, so its rank cannot exceed 10; thus D is impossible.\n\n- A (rank 20 at layer 1) can be achieved by choosing the first-layer linear map to have rank 20 and keeping ReLU in its linear regime on the batch (e.g., by appropriate scaling/offset), so the post-ReLU rank remains 20.\n\n- B (rank 50 at layer 1) can also be achieved despite the input batch having rank 25, because ReLU is nonlinear and can increase the rank across samples. For example, pick a direction v so that the projected scalars t_i = v^T x_i are distinct; choose 50 neurons with different thresholds c_j and weights proportional to v, so their activations are h_j(x_i) = ReLU(v^T x_i \u2212 c_j) = (t_i \u2212 c_j)_+. The 100 \u00d7 50 matrix with columns [(t \u2212 c_j)_+] has full column rank 50 for distinct t_i and c_j, so rank 50 is attainable.\n\n- C (rank 25 at layer 2) is also attainable by analogous design at the second layer (its width is 50), so producing rank 25 is feasible.\n\nTherefore, A, B, and C could all be true, while D cannot.\n\nAnswer: F\n\nConfidence: 78%",

If \u201c\u017ee\u201d is also present, the stress is on the first syllable of the verb (overall syllable 2), as in ne vyvelo \u017ee \u2192 2. Hence: ne vymyla \u017ee \u2192 2.\n- If a phrase begins with \u201ci ne \u2026\u201d, the stress falls on the last syllable of the phrase (cf. i ne unesla \u2192 5). Hence: i ne znali \u2192 last (4th) syllable.\n- With vy- plus \u017ee, stress is on vy (first syllable): vynesla \u017ee \u2192 1, so vyvela \u017ee \u2192 1.\n- Verbs of zn-/my- keep root stress and don\u2019t shift stress to clitics (cf. znala \u017ee \u2192 1 on zna-, i mylo \u2192 2 on my-). This is compatible with the i ne rule for i ne znali above.\n- For the mobile verbs in \u2018nes/ved\u2019 without vy-, the stress patterns match ending stress in the comparable examples (e.g., i vela \u2192 final syllable). By analogy, ponesla (po- + nes- + -la) takes final stress (3rd syllable), i povelo \u017ee (po- + vel- + -lo with i \u2026 \u017ee) keeps stress on -lo (4th syllable), and i unesli takes final stress on -li (4th syllable).\n\nApplying these:\n- i ne znali \u2192 4\n- i povelo \u017ee \u2192 4\n- ne vymyla \u017ee \u2192 2\n- ponesla \u2192 3\n- vyvela \u017ee \u2192 1\n- i unesli \u2192 4\n\nAnswer: 442314\nConfidence: 62%",

However, a single, infinitely thin plane will not function reliably as a collision object in most FLIP-based solvers (Blender Mantaflow or the FLIP Fluids add-on). Colliders are generally built from signed distance fields of closed (watertight) meshes; an open, zero-thickness plane leads to ambiguous inside/outside and fluid will leak or pass through.\n\nHow to make it work:\n- Give the plane thickness (e.g., Solidify modifier or use a very thin box) and apply transforms.\n- Set it as a collision/obstacle. In Mantaflow, use Effector Type: Collision and consider Volume Initialization = Both/Shell with increased Surface Thickness; in the FLIP Fluids add-on, use an Obstacle with Surface Thickness or a solid mesh.\n- Keep domain boundaries closed if you want it to contain the fluid. With an inflow and no outflow, the domain will fill up over time, which is functional but may be unrealistic.\n\nAnswer: No \u2014 not all components will function as described unless you give the plane obstacle some thickness or use a proper collider setup.\n\nConfidence: 90%",

This is exactly the problem of approximating a step function on the integer grid {1,\u2026,N} with a constant gap in values across the threshold at K.\n\nClassical results on discrete polynomial approximation (Ehlich\u2013Zeller/Rivlin\u2013Cheney) and, in complexity-theoretic language, Paturi\u2019s theorem on the \u03b5-approximate degree of symmetric Boolean threshold functions, show that the minimal degree needed to achieve a constant error separation at a threshold K among N points is \u0398(\u221a(K(N\u2212K))). Intuitively, the hardest part is to force a unit jump near the threshold while keeping the polynomial bounded over a very long discrete set; the optimal degree matches the \u221a(distance-to-left-edge \u00d7 distance-to-right-edge) law.\n\nApplying this with K = n^2 and N = n^{10} gives:\nd_n = \u0398(\u221a(n^2 \u00b7 (n^{10} \u2212 n^2))) = \u0398(\u221a(n^{12})) = \u0398(n^6).\n\nThus the exponent \u03b1 equals 6.\n\nAnswer: 6\n\nConfidence: 78%",

For a point on circle of radius r = t c that lies midway between two same-class prototypes, the nearest same-class distance is d_intra = 2 r sin(\u03c0/(2m)). The most dangerous competitor lies on the adjacent inner circle (radius r \u2212 c) at the same angular offset, at distance d_inter = sqrt((r \u2212 c)^2 + 4 r (r \u2212 c) sin^2(\u03c0/(2m))). Perfect 1-NN classification requires d_intra < d_inter for all t, which simplifies to sin^2(\u03c0/(2m)) < c/(4r) = 1/(4t). The tightest constraint is at the largest radius t = N, yielding:\nsin(\u03c0/(2m)) < 1/(2\u221aN).\nThus the minimal m is the smallest integer strictly greater than \u03c0 / (2 arcsin(1/(2\u221aN))). The balancing constraint forces every class to use this same m, so the minimum total number of prototypes is (N+1) m. This bound is tight (even spacing + alignment is optimal), and it is independent of c. Asymptotically, since arcsin x ~ x for small x, m ~ \u03c0\u221aN, so the total is \u2248 \u03c0(N+1)\u221aN.\n\nAnswer: Minimum total prototypes = (N+1) m*, where\nm* = the smallest integer m satisfying sin(\u03c0/(2m)) < 1/(2\u221aN)\nequivalently, m* = \u230a \u03c0 / (2 arcsin(1/(2\u221aN))) \u230b + 1.\n(Asymptotically: \u2248 \u03c0(N+1)\u221aN.)\n\nConfidence: 82%",

If such a d-th root exists, its positive word length is forced to be |\u03a6|/d, where |\u03a6| is the total number of roots of the corresponding root system. For E8 we have |\u03a6| = 240, so the minimal possible positive length for order 10 is 240/10 = 24. Existence of such roots is equivalent to d being a \u201cregular number\u201d for W(E8), and 10 is regular. For simply-laced irreducible types (including E8), the positive d-th root of \u0394\u00b2 of minimal length is unique up to conjugacy and powers of \u0394; modding out the center removes the ambiguity from central powers, and E8 has no nontrivial diagram automorphisms.

No growth.\n- For n=2, the pattern quickly reduces to the 3\u00d73 ring (eight cells around the center) and oscillates within a 5\u00d75 bounding box; it never pushes activity beyond the initial \u00b12 extent, so it cannot double.\n- For n=3, after one step the outermost diagonal cells die, leaving the inner two on each diagonal plus the 3\u00d73 ring. Crucially, in the next step this produces births at (\u00b12,\u00b11) and (\u00b11,\u00b12), which then seed births at (\u00b13,0) (and similarly on other axes) two generations later. This establishes an outward-moving \u201cwave\u201d that extends the bounding box by 1 cell along the axes every two generations. Since the initial span is 2n+1 = 7, the span eventually reaches \u226514 (e.g., by around generation 11), i.e., at least twice the original size. Hence n=3 is the smallest n>0 that causes such growth.\nAnswer: 3\nConfidence: 80%",

With strictly positive individual treatment effects, this must be > 0.\n- Case 2 (randomization conditional on X, but X omitted): Treated and control differ in the distribution of X if the propensity varies with X, so the coefficient mixes the positive treatment effect with composition differences in \u03bc0(X) = E[Y(0)|X]. This can make the coefficient negative; no guarantee of positivity.\n- Case 3 (randomization conditional on X, X included linearly): Without assuming a correct functional form in X (no interactions/nonlinearities), the D coefficient is a best linear approximation and can be written as a positive term E[\u03c4(X)Var(D|X)] plus a covariance term involving misspecification of E[Y|X] and E[D|X]. That covariance can be negative enough to overturn the positive term, so the sign is not guaranteed. Only with saturated/flexible controls (not assumed here) would the weights be nonnegative and the sign assured.\n\nAnswer: A. Only Case 1\n\nConfidence: 80%",

By the Russo\u2013Dye theorem, the operator norm of T_M equals sup over unitary X of ||M \u2218 X||. Hence c_n = ||T_{A_n}||.\n\n- Write A_n = J_n \u2212 D_n, where J_n is the all-ones matrix and D_n is the disjointness matrix with entries D_n[S,T]=1 iff S\u2229T=\u2205.

Because the fakes are lighter but identical, a balance only tells you that the counts of fakes on the two pans are equal in that weighing; it does not identify any specific coin as real.\n\nCrucially, after two weighings that both balance, you cannot certify any particular coin as real. For any given coin, there exists a placement of the four fakes (consistent with both weighings balancing) that includes that coin as fake. Concretely, after two weighings every coin has a \u201cposition signature\u201d (Left/Right/Off in each weighing). Using the large supply of coins in the various signature classes, one can always pick four coins whose signatures make the number of fakes on the left equal the number on the right in each weighing (for example, one from each of LL, LR, RL, RR, or appropriate pairs if some classes are empty), while including any designated coin. Hence no coin can be proven genuine in that worst-case outcome.\n\nSince the adversary can always realize the \u201cboth weighings balance\u201d outcome, and in that case no coin can be certified real, the maximum number of real coins that can be guaranteed to be identified with only two weighings is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0\n\nConfidence: 60%",

Minimizing the error vector is equivalent to maximizing g_i(w) = (x_i^T w)^2 for all i. If all x_i \u2265 0, any Pareto-optimal direction can be taken w \u2265 0 componentwise (since replacing w by |w| increases all g_i).\n\nAt a Pareto point w, the differentiable multiobjective Fritz\u2013John/KKT conditions yield nonnegative multipliers \u03bb_i \u2265 0 and a scalar \u03bc such that\n\u2211_i \u03bb_i (x_i^T w) x_i = \u03bc w.\nDefine M(\u03bb) = \u2211_i \u03bb_i x_i x_i^T. Then this condition is exactly M(\u03bb) w = \u03bc w, i.e., w is an eigenvector of the nonnegative symmetric matrix M(\u03bb). Because w can be chosen nonnegative and M(\u03bb) is entrywise nonnegative, Perron\u2013Frobenius implies that any strictly positive eigenvector is the principal eigenvector (and in the reducible/zero cases, a nonnegative eigenvector in the top eigenspace still attains the global maximum). Hence w is a global maximizer of w^T M(\u03bb) w over ||w||=1, i.e., a global minimizer of the weighted sum \u2211_i \u03bb_i \u03b5_i^2(w).\n\nTherefore, with x_i \u2265 0, weighted-sum scalarization recovers every Pareto point, and this argument holds for any dimension d.\n\nAnswer: E.

An F1 meiosis with exactly one crossover yields haplotypes with at most one change-point (including the two uniform parental haplotypes), totaling 10 possibilities. An F3 gamete comes from an F2 individual whose two homologs are each of that form; with a single crossover in a fixed orientation, the resulting haplotype is a concatenation of a prefix from one single-change haplotype and a suffix from another. Such a concatenation can have at most three transitions between adjacent SNPs. Conversely, any 5-bit string with at most three transitions can be produced by choosing the crossover position so each side contributes at most one transition. Among the 2^5 = 32 possible 5-bit strings, the only ones with four transitions are the two fully alternating patterns (01010 and 10101), which require more than one transition on at least one side and thus cannot be formed. Therefore, all 32 minus these 2 are possible in F3.\nAnswer: 30\nConfidence: 85%",

Each new captured square must have at least two already-infected neighbours; if it has k infected neighbours, the perimeter changes by \u0394P = 4 \u2212 2k \u2264 0. Thus P never increases.\n  With 8 isolated squares, P = 32. But we are forced to include the adjacent pair d5\u2013e5, which reduces the initial perimeter by 2, so any initial 8-set has P0 \u2264 30.\n  Therefore the final infected set must have perimeter \u2264 30. On an 8\u00d78 board, the maximum area among all shapes with perimeter \u2264 30 is 56, achieved by a full 7\u00d78 rectangle (e.g., the whole board minus one boundary column). Hence K \u2264 56.\n\n- Construction achieving 56: Take the initial 8 captured squares to be\n  a1, b2, b4, b6, b8, d5, e5, g5.\n  (Only d5 and e5 are adjacent; all others are nonadjacent, so P0 = 30.)\n  One legal sequence of growth (always using exactly two infected neighbours) is:\n  1) In column b: b3, b5, b7 become infected (between b2\u2013b4, b4\u2013b6, b6\u2013b8).\n  2) Use row 5: c5 becomes infected (between b5 and d5); then cascade in column c: c4, c3, c2 and upwards c6, c7, c8.\n  3) Cascade through columns d and e: d4, d3, d2, d6, d7, d8; then e4, e3, e2, e6, e7, e8.\n  4) Use the seed g5 to start the rightward cascade: f5 becomes infected (between e5 and g5); then f4, f3, f2, f6, f7, f8; then g4, g3, g2, g6, g7, g8.\n  5) Fill the left boundary starting from a1: a2, a3, \u2026, a8 (each using a- and b-column neighbours); then row 1: b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1.\n  The final infected set is exactly the 7 columns a\u2013g, all 8 rows: 7\u00d78 = 56 squares.

The final state has n zeros, and n is odd, so initially the number of zeros must be odd. Since the initial elements are distinct, this means the initial S must contain exactly one zero. Conversely, if 0 is present initially, pair up the remaining n-1 (even number of) nonzero elements arbitrarily. For each pair (a, b), in two days perform (a, b) \u2192 (a+b, -a-b) \u2192 (0, 0). After (n-1)/2 such pairs (i.e., n-1 days), S is all zeros; on the last day operate on (0, 0) to remain all zeros. Therefore, it is possible iff 0 is initially present.

Any offspring on the \u201cfar side\u201d with 3n/4 < |x|_1 < n has fitness strictly less than 3n/4; the only point on the far side that beats the peak is the global optimum |x|_1 = n, which has fitness 3n/4 + 1/2.

This bound is tight: when n is even, one can orient edges so that each vertex has exactly n/2 outgoing edges. Thus AT(K_{n,n}) = ceil(n/2) + 1.\n\nWith n = 1000, this gives AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 500 + 1 = 501.\n\nAnswer: 501\nConfidence: 86%",

Thus versus shown KK, AA is pure value and QQ is pure bluff. If we bet size S into pot P, villain\u2019s KK is indifferent to calling when the AA fraction among our bets q* = (P+S)/(P+2S). To maximize EV we want to bluff QQ as often as possible while keeping villain from profitably calling, which is achieved by using the largest size allowed. With P=$10 and S=$1000, the maximum feasible QQ bluff rate is ~99%, but rounding to the nearest even percent gives 98%. Any bet at these frequencies yields villain folding KK 100% to our $1000 (since our value fraction slightly exceeds indifference), giving us EV=$10 per bet. Overall EV becomes 0.5*(AA always wins $10) + 0.5*(QQ wins $10 when betting 98% and $0 when checking 2%) = $9.90, which is optimal under the rounding constraint.\nAnswer: A) BET $1000 100% \nB) BET $1000 98%, CHECK 2% \nC) FOLD 100%\nConfidence: 92%",

If you check, IP will optimally check back and win the pot with KK, so you must bet to realize value with AA. Against a perfect opponent, to force calls you must balance value with bluffs at each size so that bluff/value ratio r = s/(p + s), making his optimal call frequency c = p/(p + s) and keeping bluff EV at 0. Over multiple streets, to not run out of bluffs you keep r constant (geometric sizing) across streets, which maximizes AA\u2019s EV. With three streets remaining and stack 1000, solving for constant r that uses the whole stack gives flop bet s1 \u2248 24, turn \u2248 142, river \u2248 830.

For the regular dodecahedron (whose face angles are multiples of \u03c0/5), the first such return occurs in the smallest configuration that avoids other vertex-images and closes back at the start; its displacement vector in the unfolding has length \u221a(5 + 2\u221a5) when the edge length is 1 (this is the shortest possible such return, and it arises from the smallest admissible development that wraps around without hitting other vertices). Therefore the shortest closed geodesic length L satisfies L = \u221a(5 + 2\u221a5). Writing y = L^2 = 5 + 2\u221a5, the minimal polynomial of L over the rationals is obtained by eliminating \u221a5:\ny satisfies y^2 \u2212 10y + 5 = 0, so with y = L^2, the minimal polynomial for L is x^4 \u2212 10x^2 + 5.\n\nAnswer: x^4 \u2212 10x^2 + 5\n\nConfidence: 40%",

For hook shapes (25\u2212k,1^k), f^\u03bb = C(24,k). These are \u2264 500,000 exactly for k \u2208 {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24}, since C(24,7)=346,104 and C(24,8)=735,471.\n\n- More generally, fix k = 25 \u2212 \u03bb1 (the number of boxes off the first row). Among all partitions with this k, the dimension is maximized by the hook (25\u2212k,1^k) and minimized by the two-row shape (25\u2212k,k). This follows from the hook-length formula: spreading the k boxes into more rows decreases the hook-product and thus increases f, so the hook maximizes f; concentrating them into the second row increases the hook-product and thus minimizes f.\n\n- Therefore:\n  \u2022 If k \u2264 7, every shape with that k has f^\u03bb \u2264 f^{(25\u2212k,1^k)} \u2264 C(24,7) = 346,104 < 500,000.\n  \u2022 If k \u2265 8, every shape with that k has f^\u03bb \u2265 f^{(25\u2212k,k)}. For k=8, f^{(17,8)} = (26\u22122\u00b78)/(26\u22128)\u00b7C(25,8) = (10/18)\u00b71,081,575 = 600,875 > 500,000, so all k \u2265 8 exceed the threshold.\n\n- By conjugation the same holds for the first column: all shapes with 25 \u2212 \u03bb1' \u2264 7 (i.e., \u03bb1' \u2265 18) have f^\u03bb < 500,000; none with 25 \u2212 \u03bb1' \u2265 8 do.\n\n- Thus the eligible partitions are exactly those with either \u03bb1 \u2265 18 or \u03bb1' \u2265 18. These two sets are disjoint (having both would require at least 18 + 18 \u2212 1 = 35 boxes > 25). The count equals twice the number of partitions of 25 with largest part \u2265 18.\n\n- If the largest part is L \u2265 18, the remainder r = 25 \u2212 L \u2264 7, and the bound on part size is irrelevant, so the number with largest part exactly L is p(r), the partition number of r. Hence the count is:\n  sum_{r=0}^7 p(r) = p(0)+p(1)+...+p(7) = 1+1+2+3+5+7+11+15 = 45.\n  Doubling for conjugates gives 2\u00b745 = 90.\n\nAnswer: 90\nConfidence: 85%",

Initially, with all chairs empty, P = n + (n+1) = 2n+1 = 41.\n\nNow check how P changes with a move:\n- If a newcomer sits with no occupied neighbors (this is the only case that increases the number of occupied chairs), then locally a \u201c000\u201d (or an end \u201c00\u201d) becomes \u201c010\u201d (or \u201c10\u201d), which reduces the number of empty chairs by 1 and destroys exactly two empty gaps. Hence P drops by 3.\n- If a newcomer sits next to at least one occupied neighbor (so one neighbor leaves), the total number of empty chairs is unchanged, and the number of empty gaps either stays the same or decreases by 1. Hence P does not increase (it drops by 0 or 1).\n\nTherefore P never increases, and each +1 in occupancy causes P to drop by 3. Since P starts at 41 and cannot go below 0, the number of +1 steps (i.e., the maximum number of occupied chairs achievable) is at most floor(41/3) = 13.\n\nConstruction to reach 13 (so the bound is tight):\n- First sit people at chairs 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20 (each has no occupied neighbors at the time), reaching 7 occupants.\n- Then process the 6 disjoint triples [1\u20133], [4\u20136], \u2026, [16\u201318] from left to right. In each triple currently \u201c010\u201d, first sit at the left end (this makes the middle leave; occupancy unchanged), then sit at the right end (now isolated, so occupancy +1). Doing this for all 6 triples adds 6 more occupants, reaching 7+6=13.\n\nThus the maximum number of simultaneously occupied chairs is 13.\n\nAnswer: 13\n\nConfidence: 86%",

The interiors are disjoint, the gluing is smooth along the boundary, and the resulting closed surface contains \u03a3 as a subset. The genus adds under this boundary gluing, giving genus 10 + 10 = 20. Hence g \u2264 20.\n- Lower bound: There exist genus-10 Seifert surfaces for the unknot constructed from a spanning disk by attaching 10 tubes that each pass once through the disk. For such a \u03a3, any embedded capping surface F in the complement with the same boundary and disjoint interior must be obtained from the disk by tubing around each intersection, contributing at least one handle per passage; thus genus(F) \u2265 10.

Define S as points admitting a neighborhood on which f preserves all pairwise distances (i.e., a local isometry on a ball).\n- S is open: If x \u2208 S with a ball B\u03b5(x) on which all pairwise distances are preserved, then any y \u2208 B\u03b5(x) has a smaller ball contained in B\u03b5(x), so y \u2208 S.\n- In general, S need not be closed, connected, compact, dense, nor have connected complement. For n = m = 1, the function f(x) = x for x \u2264 0 and f(x) = \u2212x for x \u2265 0 satisfies the hypothesis and yields S = R \\ {0}, which is open but not closed, not connected, and not compact. Modifying to f(x) = x for x \u2264 0, f(x) = \u2212x for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, and f(x) = x \u2212 2 for x \u2265 1 gives S = R \\ {0, 1}, so the complement is disconnected. If m < n, then no open ball can embed isometrically into R^m, so S = \u2205, which is not dense.\n- Trivial H1 must hold: On each path-component of S, f preserves all pairwise distances on overlapping balls, hence extends to a single affine isometric embedding (Ax + b with A\u1d40A = I). Changes between such pieces can occur only across affine hyperplanes on which the two affine isometries agree; thus the components of S are convex open cells (intersections of half-spaces). Each component is contractible, so H1 of each component is 0, and therefore H1(S) = 0 (direct sum over components). The empty set also has trivial H1.\n\nTherefore, the only properties that must always hold are:\n- Open\n- Trivial first singular homology group\n\nAnswer: 2\nConfidence: 85%",

            "response": "Explanation: What you \u201csee\u201d with a VNA and a small magnetic loop is not the coil\u2019s resonance directly, but the effect of mutual coupling between your probe and the coil. There are several common reasons why a perfectly good MRI receive coil can appear \u201cnon\u2011resonant\u201d with that method:\n\n- Active detuning by default when off the scanner: Many Rx coils include PIN\u2011diode detune networks (often fail\u2011safe) that are biased to detune unless the scanner provides the proper control/bias. Off the system (or without the coil interface powered), the coil can be intentionally detuned, so your loop won\u2019t see a resonance.\n- RF shielding/ground plane: Volume coils and many array elements sit behind copper shields or backplanes that confine the RF field. If your probe is on the shielded/back side, coupling can be essentially zero. From outside a birdcage shield you may see nothing even though it works fine in situ.\n- Preamp decoupling and the wrong termination: Modern arrays rely on preamplifier decoupling (transforming the preamp input impedance to suppress loop current). Without the intended preamp/termination, the element\u2019s effective impedance and loss change drastically, so your loosely coupled loop may not show a clear S11 feature. Some designs even short or open the feed when not connected.\n- Load dependence: Coils are tuned/matched for the loaded case (patient/saline phantom). Unloaded, the resonance can shift several MHz and Q changes, so if you only look near the nominal Larmor frequency you may miss it. Sweep wider and/or load the coil with a representative phantom.\n- Coupling geometry and coil type: Your magnetic loop couples to H-fields from loop coils. If you\u2019re near a current null, wrongly oriented, or probing a dipole/slot/high\u2011impedance element, coupling can be very weak. An E\u2011field probe (small dipole) may be needed for dipole antennas; for loops, align the probe loop coplanar and close to a high-current segment.\n- Passive traps and cable baluns: Parallel-resonant traps and cable baluns can dominate the local response you\u2019re sampling, masking the element resonance in a simple sniffer measurement.\n- Narrow, very high\u2011Q response: With very light coupling the S11 perturbation can be extremely narrow and shallow. Without fine frequency resolution and averaging, it\u2019s easy to overlook.\n\nHow to verify:\n- Ensure the coil is in receive (tuned) state: provide the proper coil interface/bias or use the vendor\u2019s service jig so active detune is off.\n- Load the coil with a body-equivalent phantom and sweep a wide span around the Larmor frequency.\n- Probe from the patient-facing side, near a high-current capacitor, and orient the loop for maximum magnetic coupling; for dipoles, try an electric probe.\n- Use two small probes and measure S21 with the coil between them to reveal a resonance even when S11 barely changes.\n- Keep VNA power low enough to avoid unintentionally forward-biasing diodes, but high enough for SNR (e.g., around \u221220 to \u221210 dBm).\n\nIn short, a coil can be fully functional in the scanner yet look \u201cinvisible\u201d to a sniffer probe because it\u2019s shielded, intentionally detuned off-system, needs the correct load/termination, or your probe doesn\u2019t couple to its field.\n\nAnswer: It\u2019s possible because your VNA/loop only detects resonance via mutual coupling, and many MRI coils are shielded, actively detuned off-system, require the scanner\u2019s preamp/termination and body load to be resonant, or use geometries your probe doesn\u2019t couple to. In the scanner, those conditions change (detune off, correct load/termination), so the coil works even though you can\u2019t see a resonance with your sniffer.\n\nConfidence: 70%",

Travel from yard to dock adds 1 minute per truck. That 1 minute effectively reduces dock capacity by 1 minute per job, so treat each dock\u2019s cycle time as S = 1 + Uniform[20,35] = Uniform[21,36], with mean E[S] = 28.5 min.\n- The system is overloaded (arrival rate \u03bb = 1/7 \u2248 0.1429 per min vs total service rate 3/E[S] \u2248 3/28.5 \u2248 0.1053 per min), so throughput is capacity-limited and a queue will build.\n- Over an 8-hour (480 min) day, each dock becomes active only after the first arrivals reach it. Expected arrival times of the first three trucks are E[A1]=7, E[A2]=14, E[A3]=21 min; each then needs 1 minute travel before starting service. Hence expected available busy time per dock within the day:\n  - Dock 1: 480 \u2212 (7+1) = 472 min\n  - Dock 2: 480 \u2212 (14+1) = 465 min\n  - Dock 3: 480 \u2212 (21+1) = 458 min\n  Total available busy time \u2248 472+465+458 = 1395 min.\n- Expected number of unloads \u2248 total busy time / mean cycle time = 1395 / 28.5 \u2248 48.95, i.e., about 49 trucks completed within the 8-hour window. \n- Variability is modest: using renewal approximations, the day-to-day standard deviation is ~1 truck, so you\u2019d typically see roughly 47\u201351 unloads.\n- For context, expected arrivals in 8 hours \u2248 480/7 \u2248 68.6, so about 20 trucks would remain waiting at day\u2019s end.\n\nAnswer: About 49 trucks unloaded in an 8-hour day (on average)\n\nConfidence: 75%",

To minimize the diameter for fixed total number of vertices N = n+2 and number of leaves m, you should concentrate all branching at a single vertex (a \u201cspider\u201d): one central hub with m legs (disjoint paths) ending at the m leaves. Any other branching arrangement can only increase the maximum distance between two leaves.\n\nIn such a spider, if the m leg lengths are l_1, ..., l_m (each \u2265 1) with sum S = N \u2212 1 = n + 1, then the distance between two leaves at the ends of legs i and j is l_i + l_j. Hence the diameter is the sum of the two largest leg lengths. For fixed sum S, this maximum sum is minimized by making the leg lengths as equal as possible; that is, letting each l_i be either a = floor(S/m) or a+1, with exactly r = S \u2212 a m legs of length a+1.\n\nThus the minimum possible diameter is:\n- 2a if r = 0\n- 2a + 1 if r = 1\n- 2a + 2 if r \u2265 2\n\nEquivalently, letting S = n + 1:\nD_min = 2 ceil(S/m), except subtract 1 exactly when S mod m = 1.\n\nAnswer: Let S = n + 1, a = floor(S/m), r = S \u2212 a m.

            "response": "Explanation: \n- Let the circle have center (x0, y0) and radius R = 500. Since it is not tangent to any grid line and does not pass through any grid vertex, each vertical line x = n with n \u2208 Z such that n \u2208 (x0 \u2212 500, x0 + 500) meets the circle in exactly 2 points; there are exactly 1000 such vertical lines. Similarly, there are exactly 1000 horizontal lines y = m that meet the circle, each in 2 points. Hence the circumference intersects grid lines in I = 2\u00b71000 + 2\u00b71000 = 4000 points.\n\n- Traversing the circle, each crossing of a grid edge moves to an adjacent unit square. Encode the visited squares as vertices in the dual grid graph, with an edge each time the circle crosses a common side. In this graph, every visited square has degree 2 unless the circle passes through it twice, in which case it has degree 4. Let V be the number of squares crossed and D the number of squares crossed twice. Counting degrees gives 2V + 2D = 2I = 8000, hence V = I \u2212 D = 4000 \u2212 D. Thus minimizing (maximizing) V amounts to maximizing (minimizing) D.\n\n- A unit square can be crossed at most twice. Moreover, a double-cross can only occur in very specific places:\n  \u2022 In the unique row containing y0 (call it row j0), near the left and right extreme points of the circle. In each extreme there is a very narrow x-interval (of width \u2248 (dist(y0 to nearest horizontal line))^2/(2R) < 1) where both the upper and lower semicircles lie inside that row, producing double-cross squares. Each such narrow interval intersects either 1 or 2 unit columns; hence the row j0 contributes 2 to 4 double-cross squares (left and right ends, 1\u20132 each).\n  \u2022 Symmetrically, in the unique column containing x0 (call it column c0), near the top and bottom extremes. Each narrow y-interval intersects either 1 or 2 unit rows; hence the column c0 contributes 2 to 4 double-cross squares (top and bottom ends, 1\u20132 each).\n\n- No other double-crosses can occur: within any fixed column, the circle splits into an upper and a lower arc (y \u2265 y0 and y \u2264 y0); within any given row, into left and right arcs (x \u2264 x0 and x \u2265 x0). A single branch is monotone in the strip, so it can meet a given unit square at most once; having two disjoint arcs in one square requires contributions from both branches, which forces being in the special row (for upper/lower) or the special column (for left/right) as above.\n\n- Therefore 4 \u2264 D \u2264 8 always. Both extremes are achievable by choosing (x0, y0) to avoid tangencies/vertices and to place the tiny \u201cdouble-cross windows\u201d wholly within a single unit interval (giving 1 per side, D = 4) or straddling unit boundaries (giving 2 per side, D = 8).\n\n- Consequently V = 4000 \u2212 D ranges between 4000 \u2212 8 = 3992 and 4000 \u2212 4 = 3996.\n\nAnswer: (3992, 3996)\n\nConfidence: 73%",

The colors repeat along the laying order (helix) as R, R, B, R, B, B (period 6), so red bricks occur at positions t \u2261 0, 1, 3 (mod 6), where t is the index in laying order starting at t=0 for the first brick.\n\nAdjacency on red bricks:\n- Horizontal: the only red\u2013red horizontal neighbors are the RR pair (residues 0 and 1). The lone red at residue 3 is flanked by blues, so no horizontal move from 3.\n- Vertical: moving up to a touching brick advances along the laying order by either +10 or +11. Mod 6:\n  - +10 sends 3\u21921 (red) but 0\u21924, 1\u21925 (blue), so an up-by-10 is only possible from residue 3.\n  - +11 sends 1\u21920 (red) but 0\u21925, 3\u21922 (blue), so an up-by-11 is only possible from residue 1.\n\nStarting at t\u22610, the bug cannot go up immediately; it must move horizontally to residue 1, then go up by +11 to residue 0 in the next row. This two-move cycle (H:+1, then U:+11) is the fastest repeatable ascent on red bricks. Each such cycle advances the laying index by 12.\n\nA brick in the same vertical column as the start reappears every two rows, i.e., after 21 bricks along the laying order. Thus we need the smallest k with 12k \u2261 0 (mod 21). Since gcd(12,21)=3, this requires k \u2261 0 (mod 7), so the smallest is k=7. That takes 2k = 14 moves (seconds).\n\nAttempts to use the +10 up move don\u2019t help: to access residue 3 you must first go down by 10 from residue 1, making a -10,+10 detour that nets zero progress and only adds time.\n\nAnswer: 14\nConfidence: 92%",

For d=3 this gives E(\u03bb) = A I2 \u03bb + D I1 \u03bb^2, where I2 = \u222b|\u2207m|^2 dV > 0 and I1 = \u222b m\u00b7(\u2207\u00d7m) dV depends on the profile. This function has no minimum for \u03bb>0: it either decreases toward \u03bb\u21920 (collapse) if D I1 \u2265 0, or decreases toward \u03bb\u2192\u221e (delocalization) if D I1 < 0. Thus a finite-size localized soliton cannot be stabilized by exchange+DM alone (a Derrick/Hobart scaling argument). The ground state of this functional is a bulk helix with wavevector q = D/(2A), not a localized object. Stabilization of localized textures (skyrmions, hopfions) in 3D requires an additional term that introduces a competing scaling (e.g., Zeeman field, easy-axis anisotropy, dipolar interactions, or higher-order exchange/Skyrme term), or confinement/boundary effects; otherwise the soliton collapses or spreads.\n\nAnswer: No; exchange + DM alone in 3D cannot stabilize a localized soliton.\n\nConfidence: 90%",

Equivalently, letting S_0 = 0 and S_i = \u2211_{j=1}^i s_j a_j with s_j \u2208 {\u00b11}, we need all S_i to lie inside an interval of width at most W.

A simple three-step lemma shows that for any choice of signs, the span after processing a block (1, t, 1) is at least min(1 + t, 2 \u2212 t). Choosing t successively as 1/2, 1/4, \u2026 maximizes this minimum each time at the point where 1 + t = 2 \u2212 t, i.e., t halves each round, yielding spans 1, 3/2, 7/4, \u2026 = 2 \u2212 2^(\u2212(m\u22121)). Hence for n = 2m\u22121 (and thus also for n = 2m), f(n) \u2265 2 \u2212 2^(\u2212(m\u22121)) = 2 \u2212 2^(\u2212\u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b).\n\n- Upper bound (controlling the span): One can choose signs so that after every pair of additional steps the span increases by at most half of the remaining gap to 2. Concretely, if after some odd number of steps the span is R < 2, and the next two step lengths are at most 1, there is a choice of the two signs for those steps that ensures the new span is at most R' = R + (2 \u2212 R)/2. Starting from R = 1 after the first step, this gives the exact sequence of bounds 1, 3/2, 7/4, \u2026, i.e., after 2m\u22121 steps the span can be kept \u2264 2 \u2212 2^(\u2212(m\u22121)). Thus f(n) \u2264 2 \u2212 2^(\u2212\u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b).\n\nCombining both bounds yields f(n) = 2 \u2212 2^(\u2212\u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b).\n\nApply to n = 100000: \u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b = \u230a99999/2\u230b = 49999. Therefore\nf(100000) = 2 \u2212 2^(\u221249999).\n\nWe need 2 \u2212 2\u00b710^(\u2212M) \u2265 2 \u2212 2^(\u221249999), i.e.,\n10^(\u2212M) \u2264 2^(\u221250000).\nTaking base-10 logs gives\nM \u2265 50000\u00b7log10(2) \u2248 50000\u00b70.30103 \u2248 15051.5,\nso the minimal integer M is\nM = 15052.\n\nAnswer: 15052\nConfidence: 70%",

Any smaller sphere that is tangent to the base plane, the cone\u2019s side, and the big insphere, when viewed in a meridian cross-section, gives a small circle of radius a whose center lies a distance \u03c1 from the axis. Two key relations hold:\n- Tangency to the big sphere gives \u03c1 = 2\u221a(ra).\n- Tangency to the cone\u2019s side gives \u03c1 = R \u2212 a(R + s)/h.\n\nEliminating a yields the ratio a/\u03c1 = (\u221a(A^2 + 1) \u2212 1)/(2A), where A = (R + s)/h. If n such small spheres are placed around the big sphere and made pairwise tangent in a ring, then the chord condition on the circle of centers gives sin(\u03c0/n) = a/\u03c1.

The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in F2^3 is 7, so there are exactly 7 normal subgroups of index 4 (kernels of the surjections G \u2192 (C2)^2).\n\n2) Non-normal index-4 subgroups via the level-2 action:\nG acts on the 2-level of the binary rooted tree, giving a natural epimorphism onto a transitive 2-subgroup of S4, which is D8. The kernel is St(2), hence [G:St(2)] = 8. Preimages of order-2 subgroups of D8 are subgroups of index 4 in G. D8 has five order-2 subgroups: the central one and four reflections. The preimage of the central order-2 subgroup is normal and coincides with one of the 7 normal index-4 subgroups counted above (since the quotient by the center is V4). The four reflection subgroups correspond to the stabilizers of the four vertices at level 2; their preimages in G are non-normal subgroups of index 4. Thus this contributes 4 additional index-4 subgroups.\n\n3) No others:\nAny index-4 subgroup H has core of index 4 (yielding one of the 7 normal ones) or index 8 (factoring through the unique D8 quotient arising from the level-2 action), yielding one of the four preimages described above. Hence there are no further subgroups of index 4.\n\nTherefore, the total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 7 + 4 = 11.\n\nAnswer: 11\n\nConfidence: 65%",

Similarly, since Y = f4(X, S2) and S2 = f2(Y, Z), for z = z0 the function f2(y, z0) must be constant in y, so S2 also depends only on Z at z0. Consistency across the support then forces (S1, S2) to be functions of Z, hence H(S1, S2) \u2264 H(Z) \u2264 1. Therefore, from (\u2217), H(total) \u2264 1 + H(X | S1, S2) \u2264 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThus in all cases H(X, Y, Z, S1, S2) \u2264 2.\n\nAchievability: Take S1 and S2 to be independent fair bits (H = 1 each), define Z = S1 \u2295 S2, X = S1, Y = S2. Then all constraints hold:\n- H(s1 | z, x) = 0 via s1 = x,\n- H(s2 | y, z) = 0 via s2 = y,\n- H(x | s1, y) = 0 via x = s1,\n- H(y | x, s2) = 0 via y = s2,\n- H(z | s2, s1) = 0 via z = s1 \u2295 s2,\nand H(X, Y, Z, S1, S2) = H(S1, S2) = 2.\n\nTherefore the maximal joint entropy is 2 bits.\n\nAnswer: 2 bits\n\nConfidence: 90%",

Existential constraints reduce to (i) consistency of E-equalities (i.e., not requiring membership in two different E-classes) and (ii) non-emptiness of an interval specified by order constraints; since each E-class is dense and unbounded, any consistent quantifier-free pattern is realizable in a suitable interval.

By Sprague\u2013Grundy theory, if a heap has size a and its zero-move is unused, its Grundy number g(a) satisfies g(a) = mex({g(b) for 0 \u2264 b < a} \u222a {a}), since you can either reduce the heap to any b < a (keeping the zero unused) or use the zero-move (moving to the used state with Grundy a). Solving this recurrence gives g(a) = a+1 if a is odd, and g(a) = a\u22121 if a is even; once the zero is used, the Grundy is just a as in normal Nim.\n\nInitially all zero-moves are unused, so the position\u2019s Grundy is the xor of s_i = a_i+1 (if a_i odd) or a_i\u22121 (if a_i even).

            "response": "Explanation: For a PPAV (A, \u03bb) of dimension g, the symmetric line bundles representing \u03bb form a torsor under A[2]. Choosing such a symmetric representative is equivalent to choosing a theta characteristic, i.e., a quadratic refinement of the Weil pairing on A[2]. There are 2^{2g} theta characteristics, split into two Sp(2g, F2)-orbits: even and odd, of sizes 2^{g-1}(2^g+1) and 2^{g-1}(2^g-1), respectively. Over the fine moduli stack A_g, the monodromy reduces modulo 2 to the full Sp(2g, F2), which acts transitively on each parity class. Thus the finite \u00e9tale cover that parametrizes choices of a symmetric representative splits into two connected components of the above degrees. A global symmetric line bundle on the pulled-back universal family exists after passing to either component; the minimal possible degree is the smaller orbit size, i.e., the number of odd theta characteristics:\nD_g = 2^{g-1}(2^g - 1).\nFor g = 1, 2, 3, 4 this gives D_g = 1, 6, 28, 120.\n\nAnswer: 1, 6, 28, 120\n\nConfidence: 90%",

The quantity commonly used in solar-wind single\u2013spacecraft studies is the reduced (normalized) magnetic helicity. Under Taylor\u2019s hypothesis, the time series is interpreted as a 1-D spatial cut along the solar-wind flow, which at L1 is approximately the radial (R) direction. For that reason the definition uses the two magnetic-field components perpendicular to the sampling/flow direction (the Y and Z components in RTN). This choice is not tied to the direction of the mean magnetic field B0; it is tied to the sampling geometry. Reduced helicity is defined from the cross-spectrum of those two transverse-to-flow components and is invariant under rotations within the plane perpendicular to the flow.\n\nBecause AIC waves are polarized transverse to B0 and propagate mainly along B0, their circular/elliptical polarization still projects into the plane perpendicular to the flow. The measured reduced helicity then reflects the handedness with respect to the sampling direction; to interpret it as left/right with respect to B0 one must account for the angle between B0 and the flow (\u03b8BV) and the field sector (e.g., multiply by the sign of BR, and note that the magnitude is reduced roughly by a factor \u221d sin \u03b8BV). In practice, many studies either correct the sign using BR and/or restrict to intervals with sufficiently large \u03b8BV to ensure robust interpretation. Using field-perpendicular components directly is not appropriate for the reduced helicity with a single spacecraft because they are not, in general, both perpendicular to the sampling direction and would violate the assumptions behind the 1-D reduction.\n\nAnswer: No. The local magnetic field is not assumed to be radial at L1; the Y and Z components are used because reduced magnetic helicity is defined with the two components perpendicular to the sampling (radial flow) direction under Taylor\u2019s hypothesis. Interpretation relative to B0 then requires accounting for the B\u2013flow angle and field sector.\n\nConfidence: 76%",

The area condition gives\nab/2 = t^2\u00b7mn(m^2 \u2212 n^2) = 263,\nso mn(m^2 \u2212 n^2) must equal 263\u00b7k^2 for some integer k, and then t = 1/k. For a primitive triple, gcd(m^2 + n^2, mn(m^2 \u2212 n^2)) = 1, so c = (m^2 + n^2)/k is already in lowest terms, and the denominator of c is exactly k.\n\nThus we must find the smallest k such that mn(m^2 \u2212 n^2) = 263\u00b7k^2 with m, n coprime and of opposite parity.\n\nA parity check modulo 8 shows k must be even: since m and n have opposite parity, n is even or m is even, mn is even and m^2 \u2212 n^2 is odd, so mn(m^2 \u2212 n^2) \u2261 0, 2, or 4 (mod 8). But 263 \u2261 7 (mod 8), hence 263\u00b7k^2 \u2261 7, 0, or 4 (mod 8), which forces k even (otherwise the RHS \u2261 7 (mod 8), impossible). Moreover, if k were a power of 2, then the odd part of mn(m^2 \u2212 n^2) would have to be exactly 263. Since the odd part factors as the product of two coprime odd integers (the odd one among m, n and m^2 \u2212 n^2), this is impossible. Therefore k cannot be a power of 2; the smallest possible even k that is not a power of 2 is 6.\n\nWith further number-theoretic constraints (coprimality and factorization of the odd part), one can rule out k = 2 and k = 4 as above, and k = 6 is the least viable option. Hence the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse is 6.\n\nAnswer: 6\nConfidence: 12%",

Here T = N = 6 and L = 4, so the maximum possible diversity is 6 \u00b7 4 = 24 if \u0394S has full rank 6 for every nonzero symbol difference.\n\n- For S_a (pure cyclic shifts), \u0394S_a is circulant. There exist nonzero difference vectors, e.g., \u0394x = [a, a, a, a, a, a], that produce a rank-1 circulant matrix (all rows/columns equal up to shift), so r_min = 1 and the diversity is only 4.\n\n- For S_b and S_c, the inclusion of conjugations and sign patterns breaks this degeneracy. In particular, if only a single symbol differs (say \u0394x1 \u2260 0, others 0), \u0394S_b and \u0394S_c become permutation-like with one nonzero per row and per column, yielding determinant |\u0394x1|^6 > 0 (hence rank 6). More generally, the structure with conjugates prevents the low-rank pathologies of S_a, giving r_min = 6 (full rank) and thus full diversity.\n\nTherefore, the codes that achieve the maximum diversity order are S_b and S_c, and the maximum diversity value is 24. S_a does not achieve full diversity.\n\nAnswer: S_b and S_c; maximum diversity order = 24\n\nConfidence: 70%",

Since a cubic with positive leading coefficient tends to -\u221e as x\u2192-\u221e and +\u221e as x\u2192\u221e, there must be at least one even integer root and at least one odd integer root. Moreover, if these two integer roots were not consecutive, then for k equal to one of them, the interval (k-1, k+1) would contain exactly one root in its interior with no endpoint root, forcing f(k-1)f(k+1) < 0, a contradiction. Hence the two integer roots are consecutive: p and p+1 for some integer p.\n- Write f(x) = (x - p)(x - (p+1))(x - t). Then a = -(2p+1+t), b = p(p+1) + (2p+1)t. From f'(-1/4) = -1/4 we have 3/16 + 2a(-1/4) + b = -1/4, which simplifies to b - a/2 = -7/16. Substituting a and b gives:\n  t = [1/8 - 2(p+1)^2] / (4p + 3).\n- The sign condition further requires that for every k, any interval (k-1, k+1) containing the third root t must have an endpoint equal to one of the integer roots. This is satisfied iff t \u2208 [p-1, p+2]. Checking t(p) above shows:\n  \u2022 p = 0 \u21d2 t = -5/8 \u2208 [-1, 2] (valid), \n  \u2022 p = -1 \u21d2 t = -1/8 \u2208 [-2, 1], but then a = 9/8 so f'(1/4) = a - 1/4 > 0, violating f'(1/4) < 0,\n  \u2022 all other p give t outside [p-1, p+2], violating the sign condition.\n  Therefore p = 0, and the integer roots are 0 and 1. Then f(x) = x(x-1)(x - t) with t = -5/8. This gives a = -(1 + t) = -3/8 and b = t = -5/8; indeed f'(1/4) = a - 1/4 = -5/8 < 0, as required.\n- Finally, f(3) = 3\u00b7(3-1)\u00b7(3 - t) = 6\u00b7(3 - (-5/8)) = 6\u00b7(29/8) = 87/4.\n\nAnswer: 87/4\nConfidence: 97%",

The extra tails from the endpoints of the line segment to those vertices do not create new loops. The fundamental group of a theta graph is the free group on two generators, F2. Path-homotopy classes from one endpoint of the segment to the other form a torsor for this group, so they are in bijection with elements of F2. Allowing only finitely many self-intersections corresponds to allowing only finite reduced words in these generators. The set of such words is countably infinite. Therefore, there are countably many distinct (endpoint-fixed homotopy) classes of paths from one end of the segment to the other.\n\nAnswer: Countably infinite\n\nConfidence: 90%",

Thus H/C = (2\u00b70.01018)/0.01698 \u2248 1.20, giving the empirical C:H ratio C5H6. \n- The cryoscopic/osmometric M \u2248 150 \u00b1 10% implies the molecular formula is a multiple of C5H6. Doubling gives C10H12 (M = 132). The remaining mass suggests 1\u20132 O atoms; IR shows an \u2013OH band. Because the compound reduces Tollens\u2019 reagent, it must contain an aldehyde (or an \u03b1-hydroxycarbonyl/enediol-type reducer). Combining these, the minimal consistent formula is C10H12O2 (M = 164), which lies within the stated error of 150 \u00b1 10%. \n- X reacts with Na and NaOH and colors FeCl3 red and forms stable complexes with heavy metals. These are hallmark behaviors of o-hydroxybenzaldehyde (salicylaldehyde) motifs (phenolic OH chelating with the adjacent C=O gives strong FeCl3 color and metal chelation) and are not typical of simple alcohols. Thus X contains an o-hydroxybenzaldehyde fragment. \n- Ozonolysis (reductive workup, Zn/AcOH) of the aromatic ring of an o-hydroxybenzaldehyde bearing a C3 alkyl side chain at the para position is known to open the ring and, after cleavage of the three ring C=C bonds, give predominantly a single 5\u2011carbon tricarbonyl chain: 3\u2011oxopentane\u20111,5\u2011dial (A). Reduction of A then gives B = C5H12O3. The elemental mass fractions given for B (C 50%, H 10%, O 40%) correspond to C5H12O3, i.e., 1,3,5\u2011pentanetriol.\n- B gives exactly two monobrominated derivatives with HBr, one of which is optically active. This matches 1,3,5-pentanetriol: substituting at the central secondary OH gives one achiral monobromide (two identical ends), while substituting at either equivalent terminal OH gives the same monobromide, now with the central carbon becoming a stereocenter (chiral). Exhaustive HI reduction of this triol yields n\u2011pentane, as observed.\n- To satisfy C10H12O2, an o\u2011hydroxybenzaldehyde carrying a C3 alkyl substituent is required. The simplest fitting structure is 2\u2011hydroxy\u20114\u2011isopropylbenzaldehyde (o\u2011hydroxycuminaldehyde). It has: phenolic \u2013OH (IR, reacts with Na/NaOH, FeCl3 color, metal chelation), an aldehyde (Tollens positive), no C\u2261C, M = 164 (within the \u00b110% window), and upon ozonolysis of the ring gives A that reduces to B as above.\n\nAnswer: 2\u2011hydroxy\u20114\u2011isopropylbenzaldehyde (o\u2011hydroxycuminaldehyde)\n\nConfidence: 65%",

On the boundary gi=0 (first collision has just occurred), the system reduces to 3 particles with rate 2, and the expected remaining time for gaps (a,b) is ab/2. Thus the boundary conditions are:\n- g1=0: H = (g3 g4)/2,\n- g2=0: H = ((g1+g3) g4)/2,\n- g3=0: H = (g1 (g2+g4))/2,\n- g4=0: H = (g1 g2)/2.\n\nConsider the quadratic\nH(g) = (1/2)(g1 g2 + g3 g4 + g1 g4).\nIt matches all four boundary conditions:\n- g1=0 gives H = (1/2) g3 g4,\n- g2=0 gives H = (1/2)(g3 g4 + g1 g4) = (1/2)((g1+g3) g4),\n- g3=0 gives H = (1/2)(g1 g2 + g1 g4) = (1/2)(g1 (g2+g4)),\n- g4=0 gives H = (1/2) g1 g2.\n\nIn the interior, compute L on the quadratic terms. For adjacent products,\nL(g1 g2) = -1 and L(g3 g4) = -1:\nonly the interior particle between each adjacent pair contributes a nonzero mean change (right/left jumps yield average increment -1); moves changing just one factor have zero mean effect. For the nonadjacent product g1 g4, no single jump changes both factors, so L(g1 g4)=0. Hence\nL H = (1/2)(-1 - 1 + 0) = -1,\nas required. By uniqueness of the solution to this Poisson problem, this H is the desired expectation.\n\nSubstituting the initial gaps (g1,g2,g3,g4) = (N1, M1, N2, M2) yields\nE[\u03c4] = (1/2)(N1 M1 + N2 M2 + N1 M2).\n\nAnswer: E[\u03c4] = (N1 M1 + N2 M2 + N1 M2)/2\n\nConfidence: 86%",

Open the other 19 and let M be the maximum of the opened numbers. Guess the interval [0, M] for the closed box. Since all numbers are non-negative, this interval is bounded. You fail only if the closed box contains the global maximum among the 20 numbers. Because the closed box was chosen uniformly at random, that happens with probability 1/20. Hence this strategy succeeds with probability 1 \u2212 1/20 = 19/20 for any input.\n\nOptimality (upper bound): No strategy can guarantee success > 19/20. An adversary can place one number astronomically large and all others small. Whatever (possibly randomized) rule you use to decide which box to leave closed, some box is left closed with probability at least 1/20. If the adversary puts the huge number in that box, then any bounded interval you guess (based on the small opened numbers) will miss it with probability arbitrarily close to 1, yielding success probability at most 1 \u2212 1/20.

Thus, through the thin side it looks lighter, and through the thick side it looks a deeper green.\nAnswer: C. Thin: light green, Thick: green\nConfidence: 80%",

Here D \u2245 F2^5 and E \u2245 C5 acts linearly on D. Over F2, the irreducible representations of C5 have degrees 1 and 4 (since the order of 2 mod 5 is 4), so the action on D decomposes as 1 \u2295 4. Thus there is exactly one nonzero fixed vector (from the 1-dimensional summand), and the 15 nonzero vectors in the 4-dimensional summand split into 3 orbits of size 5; the coset of the fixed vector adds another 3 orbits of size 5. Hence the number of E-orbits on D \\ {1} is 1 + 3 + 3 = 7. Therefore k(B) \u2212 l(B) = 7.\n\nAnswer: 7\n\nConfidence: 85%",

Untrained human similarity rankings from field photos are a weak and potentially misleading proxy for ecological function because:\n- Visual system mismatch: Birds have different cone sensitivities (often UV), opponent processing, color constancy, and spatial acuity, so what looks \u201csimilar\u201d to humans may not be confusable to avian predators.\n- Image/context artifacts: Field photos vary in lighting, background (flower colors), angle, distance, motion blur, and occlusion, all of which bias human judgments and are irrelevant or different for predators.\n- Wrong viewing geometry: Predators often see bees in flight or from above; dorsal banding and pattern geometry at relevant distances matter. Lateral, perched views on flowers emphasize features predators may not use.\n- Similarity \u2260 mimicry: Convergence should be evaluated in the context of selection by predators, geographic co-occurrence (regional mimicry rings), frequency/abundance, and phylogenetic non-independence; human rankings alone cannot establish this.\n- Panel limitations: A small, untrained panel can be noisy and biased; inter-rater reliability and standardization would still be needed, and within-species variation is ignored.\n\nWhat would be more valid:\n- Use calibrated, standardized images (including UV) or spectrophotometry of dorsal color patches; map colors into avian visual space (e.g., receptor-noise/JND models) and quantify pattern geometry (e.g., boundary strength, spatial frequency) before clustering.\n- Validate with geography (sympatry), known mimicry rings, and, ideally, behavioral discrimination or field predation assays (e.g., models with avian-matched reflectance).\n- If human judgments are used at all, clearly label them as \u201chuman-perceived similarity,\u201d ensure standardized stimuli (cropped bees, constant size/orientation, calibrated lighting), assess inter-rater reliability, and treat them as exploratory, not evidence of ecological function.\n\nAnswer: No. Human similarity rankings from field images are not a valid test of mimicry\u2019s ecological function; use predator-vision-based measurements and, where possible, behavioral validation.\n\nConfidence: 85%",

Thus the game can end only when Player 2 accepts one of Player 1\u2019s offers.\n- Player 2\u2019s accept/reject decision uses one rollout for Accept (which yields the current offered amount to Player 2) and one rollout for Reject. In the Reject rollout, at the next period Player 2 proposes 0 and Player 1 accepts with probability 1/2 (by the simulation rule), giving Player 2 a simulated payoff of d with probability 1/2 (since the pie has shrunk by d) at that very next step. Hence the R-rollout sample equals d with probability 1/2 (and smaller values with the remaining probability if rejection continues).\n- Therefore, unless Player 1\u2019s offered share to Player 2 is at least d, Player 2\u2019s R-rollout will exceed the A-rollout with probability at least 1/2, making acceptance probability at most 1/2. Any attempt to offer y < d thus yields acceptance probability \u2264 1/2 and strictly worse expected payoff than ensuring immediate acceptance.\n- The optimal strategy for Player 1 is to offer y just above d (or y = d if ties break to accept), guaranteeing acceptance and giving Player 1 payoff 1 \u2212 d.\n- The Rubinstein\u2013Stahl SPE payoff to Player 1 (with common discount/shrink factor d) is 1/(1 + d).\n- The difference (optimal vs SPE) is (1 \u2212 d) \u2212 1/(1 + d) = (1 \u2212 d)(1 + d)/(1 + d) \u2212 1/(1 + d) = (1 \u2212 d^2 \u2212 1)/(1 + d) = \u2212d^2/(1 + d).\n- Writing as p(d)/q(d) = (\u2212d^2)/(1 + d), the sum of absolute values of integer coefficients is: numerator: |-1| = 1; denominator: |1| + |1| = 2; total = 3.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nConfidence: 78%",

The resulting directed graph (each node points to its nearest neighbor) has out-degree 1 everywhere, and each connected component contains exactly one mutual-nearest-neighbor pair (a 2-cycle), with directed trees feeding into that pair.\n\nBy the mass-transport principle, the expected in-degree of a typical node equals the expected out-degree, which is 1. Thus, the \u201cfamily\u201d of predecessors of a root behaves like a critical branching structure with mean offspring 1. In such critical structures, components are finite almost surely, yet the expected total progeny (i.e., expected component size) is infinite. This is a standard result for the 1-nearest-neighbor graph on a Poisson process (see, e.g., Penrose; Meester\u2013Roy).\n\nHence, although every constellation is finite with probability 1, the average number of stars per constellation diverges.\n\nAnswer: Infinite (the expectation diverges)\n\nConfidence: 85%",

Nuclear spin only affects spin-statistical weights, hyperfine structure, and line intensities/selection rules, not the existence of the inversion splitting itself.

This follows from the Chevalley\u2013Shephard\u2013Todd theorem and its corollaries: R is a free R^G-module of rank |G| precisely when G is a complex reflection group, and then R/I \u2245 R \u2297_{R^G} C has dimension |G|. \n\nThis bound is attainable here: take G to be the cyclic group of order 10000 generated by the single reflection diag(\u03b6, 1, \u2026, 1), where \u03b6 is a primitive 10000-th root of unity.

(Equivalently, build a conflict graph on grid points and enforce at most one selected per conflicting pair.)\n  3) Count constraint: sum_i x_i \u2265 N0, where N0 is the maximum number of spheres that fit in the original 12\u00d712\u00d712 box under the same 0.5 cm grid rule.\n\n- Objective: minimize the box surface area, proportional to material used:\n  minimize S = 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nBaseline capacity N0 in 12\u00d712\u00d712:\n- Along any axis, centers must lie at least 2 cm from each face and be separated by \u2265 4 cm. With the 0.5 cm grid, the admissible axis positions are {2, 6, 10}, i.e., 3 positions per axis. Within a 12\u00d712 layer, the maximum is 3\u00d73 = 9 spheres (square grid). A triangular (hexagonal) layer on the 0.5 cm grid fits only 8 in a 12\u00d712 cross-section, not more than 9.\n- Vertically, the allowed z-range is [2, 10]. Even with optimal staggering between layers (horizontal offset of at least (2,2)), the minimum safe layer spacing is 2\u221a2 \u2248 2.828 cm, so at most 3 layers fit within 8 cm thickness. Therefore the 12\u00d712\u00d712 box holds at most 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 spheres, which is achieved by the 3\u00d73\u00d73 simple cubic placement. Hence N0 = 27.\n\nCan any other integer box have smaller surface area while holding \u2265 27 spheres?\n- To reduce surface area below that of the 12\u00d712\u00d712 cube (S0 = 6\u00d712^2 = 864 cm\u00b2), at least one dimension must decrease.\n- The vertical dimension c must be \u2265 10 to allow 3 layers (z at 2, 5, 8 with 3 cm separation, which exceeds 2\u221a2). With c = 10, in-plane layers must alternate A (unshifted) and B (shifted) patterns. Let\n  nA(L) = floor((L\u22124)/4) + 1 (counts of axis positions at {2, 6, 10, \u2026})\n  nB(L) = floor((L\u22126)/4) + 1 (counts of axis positions at {4, 8, 12, \u2026})\n  Then a 3-layer A\u2013B\u2013A stack fits at most 2\u00b7[nA(a)nA(b)] + [nB(a)nB(b)] spheres.\n  - With a = b = 12: 2\u00b7(3\u00b73) + (2\u00b72) = 22 (< 27).\n  - To reach 27 with c = 10, we need nB(a) \u2265 3 and nB(b) \u2265 3, which requires a \u2265 14 and b \u2265 14. The smallest such box is 14\u00d714\u00d710, whose surface area is S = 2(14\u00b714 + 14\u00b710 + 14\u00b710) = 952 (> 864).\n- For c = 11, similar reasoning applies; a = b must still be at least 14 to get 27 with three layers, resulting in S \u2265 1008 (> 864).\n- For c \u2265 12, the minimum surface with capacity \u2265 27 is achieved at 12\u00d712\u00d712 itself (S = 864). Any reduction in a or b below 12 reduces per-layer capacity and cannot be compensated within c \u2264 12 (only 3 layers fit); increasing the other dimension raises surface area.\n\nTherefore, any box that holds at least 27 spheres has surface area \u2265 864 cm\u00b2, with equality only at 12\u00d712\u00d712. There is no more material-efficient rectangular box (with integer cm sides and 0.5 cm grid for centers) that holds as many or more spheres.\n\nAnswer: 0\nConfidence: 85%",

Surface area = 6\u00d712\u00b2 = 864.\n- Any rectangular box that holds \u226527 with centers on a 0.5 cm grid: A 12\u00d712 layer can hold at most 9 spheres, and achieving 9 forces a 3\u00d73 grid with yz-centers exactly at {2,6,10}\u00d7{2,6,10}. If two such full layers are less than 4 cm apart in x, they share identical (y,z) centers, giving center distances < 4 (collision). Hence three full layers require x \u2265 12. By symmetry, to keep 9 per layer you need 12 in both other directions. Thus, among boxes, 12\u00d712\u00d712 is already minimal; any box with area < 864 cannot hold 27.\n- Cylinders/spheres: With 0.5-grid centers, a cylinder must have R \u2265 8 to fit 9 disks per layer (3\u00d73 at z = 2,6,10) and h \u2265 12 for 3 layers, giving area 2\u03c0Rh+2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 320\u03c0 \u2248 1005 > 864.

Restricting centers to a 0.5 grid inside R = 6 allows at most 5 per layer (center plus four axis points), forcing \u22656 layers for \u226527 and area > 864.\n\nTherefore, no container with less surface area than the 12\u00d712\u00d712 box can hold at least 27 balls under the 0.5 cm precision constraint.\n\nAnswer: 0\nConfidence: 70%",

But if C lay entirely in A (resp. in B), \u03c02(C) would be a connected subset of D (resp. of [0,1] \\ D), hence a single point; and then within that horizontal slice C must be a singleton as observed above. A connected set cannot straddle A and B while keeping connectivity because any horizontal slice is totally disconnected, so one cannot \u201cbridge\u201d between different y\u2019s through slices that contain no connected pieces. Thus every connected component of X is a singleton.\n- Now pass to the quotient Y by identifying all points of Q \u00d7 {1} to a single point p. This operation glues together countably many singleton components into one singleton p; it does not create any new nontrivial connected subsets, because the only identified set was a discrete (in the subspace sense) set lying in a single horizontal slice, and slices remain totally disconnected.\n- Therefore, every connected component in Y is a singleton. The number of components equals the number of points of Y: \n  |(K \\ Q) \u00d7 ([0,1] \\ D)| + |Q \u00d7 (D \\ {1})| + 1.\n  Here |K \\ Q| = continuum, |[0,1] \\ D| = continuum, so their product has cardinality continuum; |Q \u00d7 (D \\ {1})| is countable; adding 1 does not change cardinality. Hence Y has continuum (uncountably many) components.\n\nAnswer: Continuum many (uncountably many) components.\n\nConfidence: 63%",

With these oracles, the standard Karp\u2013Luby estimator gives an FPRAS for |\u222ay S_y|, hence for CountAns.\n\n2) Exact counting is hard. Counting distinct projections of conjunctive queries with self-joins (our query is the star CQ \u2203y \u2227_{i=1}^k E(x_i,y) with projection to the free variables) is known to be #P-complete in combined complexity, even for very simple acyclic/star-shaped queries with self-joins. Moreover, in the parameterized setting, the exact counting version is hard for the counting W-hierarchy (in particular, hard for #W[2]) under standard parameterized reductions, reflecting that no f(k)\u00b7poly(n) exact algorithm is expected.\n\nPutting these together, CountAns:\n- admits an FPRAS (by the union-of-sets scheme),\n- but is hard for both #P (classically) and #W[2] (parameterized exact counting).\n\nAnswer: C\n\nConfidence: 62%",

Any endomorphism of G induces one on A and restricts to one on T, so End(G) maps into End(T) \u00d7 End(A), with compatibility constraints depending on the extension class. If the extension splits (G \u2245 A \u00d7 T), then End(G) \u2245 End(A) \u00d7 End(T), typically giving more endomorphisms than A alone. For a non-split or \u201cgeneric\u201d extension, the compatibility can severely restrict endomorphisms, and End(G) may be no larger than (and can even be smaller than) what one might get by combining End(A) with End(T).

Let S = a+b+c = 2^32 and define\nx = a+b\u2212c, y = a+c\u2212b, z = b+c\u2212a.\nThen f = Sxyz with x,y,z \u2265 0, x \u2264 y \u2264 z, x+y+z = S, and parity constraints imply x,y,z are all even. Put x = 2x', y = 2y', z = 2z' so x'+y'+z' = T = S/2 = 2^31 and f = 8S x'y'z'.\n\n- The smallest value is 0 (when one of x,y,z is 0).

Since T \u2261 2 (mod 3), the maximum is at (k, k+1, k+1) with k = (T\u22122)/3, and the second maximum is at (k, k, k+2). Thus M = 8S\u00b7k^2(k+2).\n\nTherefore m + M = 8S[(T\u22122) + k^2(k+2)].

Hence det(A) and det(B) are the determinants of their 3\u00d73 top-left blocks.\n\n- For A, using the given entries and the fact that the 3rd row equals the 2nd row minus [0,1,0], the 3\u00d73 determinant reduces to the 2\u00d72 minor using columns 1 and 3 of the first two rows:\n  det(A) = a11 b13 \u2212 a13 b11,\n  which simplifies exactly to\n  det(A) = 2 x1 (1 \u2212 x2) + (2 x4 \u2212 1) x3.\n  Here x1, x2, x3, x4 are i.i.d. N(0,1). Thus det(A) is a continuous real-valued random variable with an everywhere-positive density (a normal variance-mixture), mean 0, and Var(det(A)) = 13.\n\n- For B, the 3\u00d73 top-left block has third row [0,0,1], so det(B) equals the determinant of its 2\u00d72 upper-left block. A short algebra gives\n  det(B) = 1 + (x5/7) sqrt(log(x6^98) \u2212 196).\n  With x6 ~ Pareto(e^2, 1), we have log x6 = 2 + W where W ~ Exp(1), hence sqrt(log(x6^98) \u2212 196) = sqrt(98 W) = 7\u221a2\u221aW. Therefore\n  det(B) = 1 + \u221a2 x5 \u221aW.\n  Noting that if H = \u221a(2W) with W ~ Exp(1), then H is Rayleigh(1), and x5 H has a Laplace(0,1) law. Hence\n  det(B) ~ 1 + Laplace(0,1),\n  i.e., it has density q(y) = (1/2) e^{\u2212|y \u2212 1|}, y \u2208 \u211d.\n\n- Therefore the R\u00e9nyi divergence is\n  D_a(P_detA || Q_detB) = (1/(a\u22121)) log \u222b_\u211d p_A(y)^a q(y)^{1\u2212a} dy,  a > 1,\n  so\n  \u2113(a) = log \u222b_\u211d p_A(y)^a [1/2 e^{\u2212|y\u22121|}]^{1\u2212a} dy,\n  where p_A is the density of det(A) = 2 x1 (1 \u2212 x2) + (2 x4 \u2212 1) x3. One can write p_A as a normal variance-mixture:\n  p_A(y) = \u222b_0^\u221e \u222b_0^\u221e \u03c6(y; 0, h1^2 + h2^2) f_{H1}(h1) f_{H2}(h2) dh1 dh2,\n  with H1 = 2|1 \u2212 X2| (X2 ~ N(0,1)) and H2 = |2X4 \u2212 1| (X4 ~ N(0,1)), whose densities are folded-normal. \n\n- There is no known closed-form for this integral for general a > 1. The integrand is positive and the tails ensure convergence (both p_A and q have Laplace-type tails), so \u2113(a) is finite for all a > 1, but not expressible in a simple closed form in terms of elementary/special functions.\n\nAnswer: No closed-form expression exists for \u2113(a).

For 0<u<1 we have u'<0 (so u\u21920 as t\u2192\u221e), while for u>1 we have u'>0 (so u increases and blows up in finite time). Hence the line u=1 separates the phase plane into two invariant regions: {0\u2264u<1} and {u>1}.\n\nOn u=1, the d\u2013dynamics is d' = 2d(d+1), giving equilibria at (d,u)=(\u22121,1) and (0,1). Linearization shows (\u22121,1) is a saddle (eigenvalues \u22122 and 1), and its 1D stable manifold lies entirely in the invariant line u=1 and corresponds to d<0 (solutions on u=1 with d<0 converge to d=\u22121). Therefore the separatrix through the saddle (the stable separatrix) is the half-line {u=1, d<0}. Globally, the whole line u=1 is the separatrix in the upper half-plane, separating trajectories with u\u21920 (below) from those with u\u2192\u221e (above).\n\nAnswer: The separatrix is the invariant line u=1; specifically, the stable separatrix through the saddle (\u22121,1) is the half-line {u=1, d<0}.\n\nConfidence: 78%",

A quick way to see this is to write the area as the integral of vertical chord lengths l(x); l(x) is concave for a convex set, supported on an interval of length w_x and with maximum w_y, so its integral is minimized by a triangular profile, giving \u222b l(x) dx \u2265 (w_x\u00b7w_y)/2.\n\n- Therefore, any such K has area at least (2\u00b72)/2 = 2.\n\n- This lower bound is attained by the diamond D = { (x,y): |x|+|y| \u2264 1 }, which has area 2.

In an ideal, unconfounded population, any predictor that is a function of genotype (including a polygenic score) cannot explain more than H^2 of phenotypic variance, so 50% is an absolute upper bound. With arbitrarily large GWAS, a standard additive PGS approaches (at best) the additive genetic variance h^2, which may be less than H^2 if there is non-additive variance; thus B is not necessarily true. C is not necessarily true either because if all genetic variance were additive (H^2 = h^2 = 0.5), an additive PGS could approach 50%. D is false because the presence of epigenetic effects does not by itself constrain h^2 to be < 0.5; epigenetic effects contribute to non-genetic (environmental) variance under typical definitions, and h^2 could still equal 0.5.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nConfidence: 78%",

By Sturm\u2013Liouville theory this yields exactly one positive L^2-eigenvalue for L_0, with an even, radial eigenfunction. For \u2113\u22651, the additional repulsive barrier +\u03bb_\u2113/\u27e8\u03c1\u27e9^2 (in \u2212L_\u2113) prevents any bound states (Hardy inequality gives nonnegativity), so there are no positive eigenvalues in nonradial sectors.\n\nThus the catenoid\u2019s Jacobi operator has exactly one positive L^2-eigenvalue; equivalently, the (generalized) catenoid has Morse index one.

To see the k\u22121 term is necessary, let S be a set of k vertices. Let H be K_k with one missing edge on S (and add a private leaf to each vertex of S to avoid isolates), so tw(H) = k\u22122.

However, where gas is trapped (typically the interior), pores pin grain boundaries and suppress grain growth, while near the surface gas can escape, allowing more densification and grain growth.

By a union bound over the q queries, the rejection probability is at most O(q)\u00b7\u03b4(\u03c0,\u03a0(x)), i.e., the PCP is Blue with C=O(q).\n\nThe \u201cRed\u201d side is the robust (a.k.a. locally testable) soundness property: there are robust PCPs for NP with O(log n) randomness and O(1) queries whose rejection probability lower-bounds the distance to \u03a0(x) by a constant factor (\u03a9(\u03b4)). Such robust PCPs (e.g., obtained via Dinur-style gap amplification/composition and standard LTC/assignment-tester frameworks) are known.\n\nPutting these together, a robust PCP with a smooth query distribution is both Red and Blue, yielding rejection probability \u0398(\u03b4(\u03c0,\u03a0(x))). This does not contradict P\u2260NP; the Blue upper bound does not give an efficient way to find a correct proof\u2014only to calibrate acceptance on a given oracle proof\u2014so no NP=RP/P consequence follows from having both properties.\n\nAnswer: Yes.

The matrix P_{(n)} is invertible: writing a_{ij} = min(i,j) \u2212 ij/(n+1), one has (a_{ij}) = T^{-1} where T is the tridiagonal matrix with 2 on the diagonal and \u22121 on the off-diagonals. Since P_{ij} = (\u22121)^{i+j} a_{ij} = (S a S)_{ij} with S = diag((\u22121)^i), we get P^{-1} = S T S, i.e., the tridiagonal matrix Y with 2 on the diagonal and +1 on the first sub- and super-diagonals, zeros elsewhere.\n- Let M = M_{(n)} with diagonal entries \u03b1 = sqrt(n^2 \u2212 n + 1)/n and off-diagonal entries \u03b2 = 1/n. For the j-th column y_j of Y: y_j has entries 2 at row j, 1 at rows j\u00b11 (in-range), 0 otherwise. The j-th column m_j of M has entry \u03b1 at row j and \u03b2 elsewhere.

For a fixed pair (k1,k2) with k1\u22600, the equation is autonomous in t and x and its coefficients do not depend explicitly on t or x, while the source depends only on u. The Lie point-symmetry determining equations for the semilinear heat class u_t = u_xx + f(u) imply that, for a generic nonlinearity f(u), the admitted Lie algebra is generated by translations in t and x only (plus discrete reflections). In particular, the u-scaling or Galilean/scaling (Schr\u00f6dinger) symmetries of the linear heat equation are broken by the u ln u term: under u\u2192\u03bbu, an extra term k1(ln \u03bb)u appears and cannot be canceled by any x,t-point transformation. Therefore:\n\n- For k1\u22600 (any k2), the maximal Lie point symmetries are\n  X1 = \u2202_t (time translations), X2 = \u2202_x (space translations).\n  The corresponding one-parameter finite transformations are:\n  \u2022 Time shift (parameter \u03b51): t' = t + \u03b51, x' = x, u' = u.\n  \u2022 Space shift (parameter \u03b52): t' = t, x' = x + \u03b52, u' = u.\n  There is also the discrete reflection x\u2192\u2212x (no infinitesimal generator).\n\n- Special linear case k1=0 (u_t = u_xx + k2 u): the equation is linear and, after the gauge w(t,x)=e^{\u2212k2 t}u(t,x), reduces to the pure heat equation, hence it admits the full Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry algebra. The induced x-transformations (listing the usual one-parameter subgroups) are:\n  \u2022 Space translations: x' = x + \u03b5.\n  \u2022 Galilean boosts: x' = x + v t.\n  \u2022 Dilations (heat scaling): x' = e^\u03c3 x (with t' = e^{2\u03c3} t).\n  \u2022 Projective time transformations (inversions): x' = x/(1 \u2212 \u03ba t) (with t' = t/(1 \u2212 \u03ba t)).\n  Compositions of these, together with time translations, give the general x-representation of the Schr\u00f6dinger group action. For k2\u22600 these act on u with an additional time-dependent gauge, but the x-part remains as above.\n\nThus, for the given nonlinear source with k1\u22600, a Lie group of infinitesimal transformations leaving the PDE invariant is the 2-parameter translation group generated by \u2202_t and \u2202_x; its action on x is the space translation x' = x + \u03b5 (and identity under time shifts). Only in the special linear case k1=0 do the additional x-transformations (Galilean, scaling, projective) appear.\n\nAnswer: \n- Generic (k1 \u2260 0): infinitesimal generators {\u2202_t, \u2202_x}. Finite action on x:\n  \u2022 Time shift: x' = x\n  \u2022 Space shift: x' = x + \u03b5\n- Special linear case (k1 = 0): in addition to translations,\n  \u2022 Galilean: x' = x + v t\n  \u2022 Scaling: x' = e^\u03c3 x (with t' = e^{2\u03c3} t)\n  \u2022 Projective (inversion): x' = x/(1 \u2212 \u03ba t)\n\nConfidence: 62%",

The condition |S_i \u0394 S_j| = |i \u2212 j| implies that along the sequence (S_1, \u2026, S_n), each step i \u2192 i+1 flips exactly one element, and no element can be flipped twice (otherwise some |S_i \u0394 S_j| would be smaller than |i \u2212 j|). Thus each element either:\n- is present for all n indices (never flipped), contributing n to the total sum, or\n- is removed at step t, contributing t (present for indices 1..t), or\n- is added at step t, contributing n \u2212 t (present for indices t+1..n).\n\nHence the total sum is\nsum |S_i| = R\u00b7n + \u2211_{t=1}^{n\u22121} c_t,\nwhere R \u2265 0 is the number of elements present throughout, and each c_t \u2208 {t, n \u2212 t} depends on whether step t is a deletion or an addition.\n\nA trivial lower bound is obtained by taking at each step the cheaper option:\n\u2211_{t=1}^{n\u22121} min(t, n \u2212 t) = \u230an^2/4\u230b.\nHowever, the non-emptiness constraint (|S_i| \u2265 1 for all i) forces us to deviate from always taking the cheaper option: if we took all the cheaper moves (deletions for t \u2264 \u230an/2\u230b, additions for t \u2265 \u2308n/2\u2309) with R = 0, we would make the sets empty midway. To prevent that, we must switch at least one early step to an addition and at least one late step to a deletion. The extra cost incurred by these two switches is at least 2 in total (for odd n it is 1+1; for even n it is 0 at t = n/2 plus 2 at t = n/2+1). Therefore\nsum |S_i| \u2265 \u230an^2/4\u230b + 2.\n\nThis bound is tight. Let m = \u230an/2\u230b and take R = 0. Start with |S_1| = m. Perform deletions at steps t = 1, 2, \u2026, m\u22121; then an addition at t = m; then a deletion at t = m+1; and additions at all remaining steps. Use distinct elements each time. This keeps every |S_i| \u2265 1 and maintains |S_i \u0394 S_j| = |i \u2212 j|. The total is exactly\n\u2211 min(t, n \u2212 t) + 2 = \u230an^2/4\u230b + 2.\n\nFor n = 2, a direct example S_1 = {a}, S_2 = {a, b} gives sum 3 = \u230a4/4\u230b + 2. Thus for all n, the minimum is \u230an^2/4\u230b + 2.\n\nAnswer: B. \u230an^2/4\u230b + 2\nConfidence: 96%",

This gives a robust, constructive \u201cyes.\u201d\n- For lacunary (Hadamard gap) sets n_{j+1}/n_j\u2265q>1, a classical theorem (Zygmund; lacunary series theory) says: if \u2211 a_{n_j} e^{i n_j t} converges on a set of positive measure (in particular, everywhere), then \u2211|a_{n_j}|<\u221e. Thus such S cannot meet the \u201cnot absolutely convergent\u201d requirement.\n- For polynomial phases n^k, there are Weyl/van der Corput bounds: for every fixed t, the partial sums S_N(t)=\u2211_{n\u2264N} e^{i n^k t} satisfy |S_N(t)|\u2272 N^{1-\u03b4_k} with \u03b4_k>0 (e.g., \u03b4_k=2^{-(k-1)}). Summation by parts then shows that \u2211 (1/n) e^{i n^k t} converges for each t. Choosing alternating signs fixes convergence at t=0 (z=1), while \u2211|a_{n^k}|=\u2211 1/n=\u221e ensures non-absolute convergence.\n\nNow the four cases.\n\n1) S = {\u2211_{k\u2264n} N_k} with N_k i.i.d. Poi(1):\nP(N_k=1)>0 and the N_k are independent, so with probability 1 there are arbitrarily long runs of consecutive 1\u2019s. Each such run produces an arbitrarily long block of consecutive integers inside S. Using these blocks, one constructs coefficients by placing alternating, slowly varying magnitudes along each block so that:\n- on |z|=1, each block\u2019s contribution is controlled by Dirichlet\u2019s test (bounded geometric partial sums on consecutive exponents), yielding convergence at every boundary point and hence everywhere on the closed disk;\n- the total \u2211|a_n| diverges by taking enough mass on longer and longer blocks.\nTherefore 1 holds almost surely.\n\n2) S = {n^k} for k\u22654:\nTake a_{n^k}=(-1)^n/n. For z=e^{it} on the unit circle,\n\u2211 a_{n^k} z^{n^k} = \u2211 (1/n) e^{i(\u03c0 n + t n^k)}.\nBy Weyl\u2013van der Corput estimates for polynomial phases of degree \u22652, for each fixed t the partial sums of e^{i(\u03c0 n + t n^k)} are O(N^{1-\u03b4_k}) with some \u03b4_k>0 (for k\u22654, one may take \u03b4_k\u22652^{-(k-1)}). Summation by parts then gives convergence of the above series for every t. At z=1 it is the alternating harmonic series, so it converges. Moreover, \u2211|a_{n^k}|=\u2211 1/n diverges, so it is not absolutely convergent on |z|=1. Hence 2 holds.\n\n3) S = primes:\nUnlike 1, S has no long blocks of consecutive integers; and unlike 2, we lack uniform polynomial-phase cancellation. Known bounds for exponential sums over primes show partial sums along the circle can be as large as \u224d N/ log N (for suitable t), which is too large to be neutralized everywhere by any fixed coefficient sequence with \u2211|a_p|=\u221e via summation by parts. In particular, one cannot arrange convergence for all |z|=1 without forcing \u2211|a_p|<\u221e. Thus 3 fails.\n\n4) S = {\u230a(\u03c0/2)^n\u230b}:\nThis is a Hadamard lacunary sequence (ratio >1). By the classical lacunary series theorem (e.g., Zygmund), if a lacunary series \u2211 a_{n_j} e^{i n_j t} converges on a set of positive measure on the circle (a fortiori, everywhere), then \u2211|a_{n_j}|<\u221e. That contradicts the \u201cnot absolutely convergent on |z|=1\u201d requirement. Hence 4 fails.\n\nPutting these together: only 1 and 2 have the desired property.\n\nAnswer: F.

Let p_i \u2208 {0,1,2} be how many private approvals (from {9,\u2026,24}) voter i gets; then voter i\u2019s utility is u_i = x + p_i and s(N,W) = \u03a3_i u_i = 8x + \u03a3_i p_i. Let y = \u03a3_i p_i.\n\n- EJR: For S = N with \u2113 = 8, at least one voter must have u_i \u2265 8. Since each voter has only 2 privates, this forces x \u2265 6 (because 6 commons + 2 privates = 8). To minimize s(N,W), take x = 6 and give p_i = 2 to exactly 5 voters (so 5 voters have u=8, the other 3 have u=6). This satisfies all EJR constraints (for every cohesive subset of N, there is a member with the required quota). Also the candidate-pool constraint (only 8 non-N candidates exist: {25,\u2026,32}) forces at least 12 selections from {1,\u2026,24}, which holds since x + y = 6 + 10 = 16. Hence s(N,W2) = 5\u00b78 + 3\u00b76 = 58.\n\n- Core: Consider S = N (size 8) with proportional budget 2|S| = 16; they can always pick the 8 commons plus 8 privates. To block, they need to strictly improve every voter. Writing e_i = max(0, u_i \u2212 7), S can block iff \u03a3_i e_i \u2264 8 (they have only 8 private slots). Thus for W to be in the core, we need \u03a3_i e_i \u2265 9. With x = 6, e_i \u2208 {0,1} and \u03a3_i e_i \u2264 8, so no committee with x=6 is in the core. Take x = 7 so e_i \u2208 {0,1,2}; then the minimal y = \u03a3_i p_i satisfying all subset-core constraints (including s = 4,\u2026,8) is y = 9, achievable with counts (p=2 for 4 voters, p=1 for 1 voter, p=0 for 3 voters). This yields u-vector (9,9,9,9,8,7,7,7), which exactly meets the tight core bounds for all S \u2286 N. The candidate-pool constraint also holds since x + y = 7 + 9 = 16 \u2265 12. Therefore s(N,W1) = 8\u00b77 + 9 = 65.\n\n- Hence the ratio is 65/58.\n\nAnswer: 65/58\n\nConfidence: 85%",

Checking permutations of {1/3, 3/2, 2} yields exactly one solution: arr3 = 2, arr4 = 3/2, arr5 = 1/3, giving S4 = 1.5\u00b7(3 + 1/3) = 5.\n\nHence the physical order of aFCs is 3, 1/2, 2, 3/2, 1/3, i.e., ranks 5,2,4,3,1. Reporting in the direction that starts with the lower rank gives 1,3,4,2,5.\n\nAnswer: 13425\nConfidence: 95%",

Over the integers modulo p^k, the only potential coefficients that can avoid a factor p come from consistently choosing at each iteration only the two terms Y^{p^k} and Y^{p^{k-1}} in the above congruence; any other choice introduces at least one extra factor of p and cannot contribute to the same target degrees.

Thus \u03c0 is an involution (only 1- and 2-cycles). The number of involutions in S8 is T8 = \u03a3_{m=0}^4 8!/(m! 2^m (8\u22122m)!) = 1 + 28 + 210 + 420 + 105 = 764.\n- Symmetry about the anti-diagonal sends \u03c0 to r \u2218 \u03c0^{-1} \u2218 r, where r(i) = 9\u2212i. Invariance thus requires \u03c0 = r \u2218 \u03c0^{-1} \u2218 r, i.e., r\u2218\u03c0 is an involution. Hence the count is again 764.\n\nWe need placements symmetric about at least one diagonal, so use inclusion\u2013exclusion. The overlap consists of permutations symmetric about both diagonals: \u03c0 = \u03c0^{-1} and r\u03c0r = \u03c0, i.e., \u03c0 commutes with r.\n\nTo count these, group rows (and columns) into the 4 opposite pairs {1,8}, {2,7}, {3,6}, {4,5}. Any \u03c0 commuting with r permutes these 4 pairs by an involution \u03c3 \u2208 S4 and, for each \u03c3-orbit, chooses whether to flip within the pair. If \u03c3 has m transpositions, it has 4\u2212m orbits, giving 2^{4\u2212m} choices for flips. Summing:\n- m=0: 1 choice of \u03c3, 2^4 = 16 flips \u2192 16\n- m=1: 6 choices of \u03c3, 2^3 = 8 flips each \u2192 48\n- m=2: 3 choices of \u03c3, 2^2 = 4 flips each \u2192 12\nTotal overlap = 16 + 48 + 12 = 76.\n\nThus total configurations = 764 + 764 \u2212 76 = 1452.\n\nAnswer: 1452\nConfidence: 81%",

Add the vertices from rows 2 and 3 one by one. Each such vertex has degree at most 2 and its two neighbors lie on the outer face; placing the new vertex in that face and joining it to its two neighbors preserves outerplanarity. Hence the entire 4\u00d7m (3,2)-leaper graph is outerplanar (and thus planar) for every m. The same argument applies symmetrically to n\u00d74 boards for every n.\n\nTherefore, there are planar graphs G on n\u00d7m boards with n,m \u2265 4 for arbitrarily large nm (take n = 4 and let m \u2192 \u221e, or vice versa).

B2 has better area/$, so we prioritize B2 subject to non-overlap and fitting inside the rectangle. With radius 2 km, the tightest non-overlapping packing in a 12\u00d711 rectangle allows 3-2-3 rows (centers at x = 2,6,10 for long rows; x = 4,8 for the middle row; vertical spacing \u221a3\u00b72 \u2248 3.464 km), yielding a maximum of 8 B2 towers.

Geometrically, in the 8-B2 close packing the only feasible locations for B1 (radius 1) without overlap are along the left and right sides near the middle row; this admits 2 B1.

Let S be the span of all such moves in F2^{n^5}. Starting from the all-ones vector 1, reaching a single gift at position p means e_p + 1 \u2208 S. This is equivalent to requiring that for every invariant y in S^\u22a5 one has y\u00b7(e_p + 1) = 0.\n\nBy tensor structure, S^\u22a5 = (W^\u22a5)^{\u22975}, where W^\u22a5 \u2282 F2^n is the set of 1D sequences y with every length-7 sliding sum zero:\ny_i + y_{i+1} + ... + y_{i+6} = 0 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n-6.\n\nLet s_k = sum_{j=1}^k y_j (mod 2), with s_0 = 0. The constraint implies s_{m+7} = s_m for 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n-7. Writing r = n mod 7, it follows that the total sum S(y) = s_n = s_r, while a coordinate value is y_p = s_p + s_{p-1} = s_{p mod 7} + s_{(p-1) mod 7}.\n\nFor the 5D invariant, for y = y_1 \u2297 ... \u2297 y_5 with each y_i \u2208 W^\u22a5:\n- y\u00b7e_p = \u220f_{i=1}^5 y_i(p_i),\n- y\u00b71 = \u220f_{i=1}^5 S(y_i) = \u220f_{i=1}^5 s_r(y_i).\n\nTo have y\u00b7e_p = y\u00b71 for all choices of y_i, one must have y_i(p_i) = S(y_i) for all y_i in W^\u22a5, for each axis i. From the formulas above, this identity holds for all y iff:\n- n \u2261 1 (mod 7) and p_i \u2261 1 (mod 7), since then y_i(p_i) = s_1 = s_r;\n- n \u2261 6 (mod 7) and p_i \u2261 0 (mod 7), since then y_i(p_i) = s_6 = s_r.\n\nIf n \u2261 0 (mod 7), then S(y) = 0 for all y, so y\u00b71 = 0 always, but one can choose y_i with y_i(p_i) = 1, giving y\u00b7e_p = 1, a contradiction; hence impossible. For other residues r \u2208 {2,3,4,5}, no p can make y_p equal s_r for all y.\n\nTherefore, a single gift is reachable iff n \u2261 1 or 6 (mod 7).

            "response": "Explanation: Model each 1 in the n\u00d7m binary matrix as a token. A move consists of choosing any nonempty row or column and removing any positive number of tokens in that line; the player who removes the last token wins (normal play). For random boards (each entry i.i.d. fair coin), f(n,m) asks whether the probability that the first player has a winning position exceeds 1/2.\n\nKey structural fact (well known for this \u201crows-and-columns Nim\u201d): \n- On an n\u00d7n board with n\u22652, the P-positions (second-player wins under optimal play) are exactly the symmetric matrices (A = A^T). Proof sketch: If the position is symmetric, the second player mirrors every move of the first across the main diagonal and wins. If it is not symmetric, the first player can, on the first move, delete exactly the asymmetric part along a suitable row or column to make the board symmetric, then adopt the mirror strategy. The only degenerate exception is the 1\u00d71 board, where the single-1 position is not a P-position because the first player wins immediately.\n- On a 1\u00d7m (or n\u00d71) board with m\u22652, every nonempty board is a first-player win (the first removes all 1s in that single line).\n\nConsequences for random inputs:\n- For 1\u00d71, the first-player win probability is exactly 1/2 (since the single cell is 1 with probability 1/2), so \u201cstrictly more than 50%\u201d fails.\n- For any other dimensions (n,m) \u2260 (1,1), the set of losing positions (symmetric for square boards with n\u22652; empty only for 1\u00d7m or n\u00d71) has strictly less than half of all matrices. In particular, for n\u00d7n with n\u22652, symmetric matrices form a 2^{n(n+1)/2}-sized subset out of 2^{n^2} possible boards, which is strictly less than half once n\u22653, and equals exactly half at n=2; but at n=2 the nonsymmetric positions are exactly the first-player wins, making the winning probability 1/2, and adding the (measure-zero in the limit but positive) cases where the first removes all tokens in one move still do not reduce it below 1/2. For 1\u00d7m (m\u22652) or n\u00d71 (n\u22652), the only losing board is the all-zero board, which occurs with probability 2^{-max(n,m)} < 1/2.\n\nTherefore, f(n,m) is trivially decidable in constant time:\n- f(1,1) = 0 (probability = 1/2, not strictly more).\n- f(n,m) = 1 for all other (n,m).\n\nThus the computational complexity of f is O(1) time (and O(1) space); in particular, f is in AC^0 (indeed, computable by a tiny constant-depth circuit checking whether n=m=1).\n\nAnswer: f is computable in constant time: f(1,1)=0 and f(n,m)=1 for all other (n,m).\n\nConfidence: 62%",

However, rare excursions into the upper rail create \u201cdead-end\u201d traps that cause very long delays when the bias is large.\n\nFrom a lower vertex with a rung, the probability to go up is about e^{-c}. Conditional on going up, with probability \u22481 the walk is driven to the right along the upper rail until it hits the first missing right edge (a \u201cwall\u201d). If the vertical rung at that wall is present (probability 1/2), the walk goes down immediately (no serious delay). If the rung is absent (probability 1/2), the walk is trapped near the wall: it bounces between the last two upper vertices, and only escapes by making rare left moves against the bias and then taking a rare vertical down move at a rung.\n\nLet G be the distance (in upper horizontal steps) from the wall to the nearest rung to its left; G is geometric with P(G=g)=2^{-g}. To exit, one needs roughly (G\u22121) rare left moves (each costing probability \u2248 e^{-2c} per attempt) and, at the rung site, a rare down move (probability \u2248 e^{-c}). This yields an expected escape time of order e^{(2G\u22121)c}. Multiplying by the probability to enter the upper rail (\u2248 e^{-c}), the expected delay per potential trap is of order\nE[e^{-c} e^{(2G\u22121)c}] = \u2211_{g\u22651} 2^{-g} e^{(2g\u22122)c} = (1/2) \u2211_{k\u22650} (e^{2c}/2)^k,\nwhich diverges for large c (indeed as soon as e^{2c}/2 \u2265 1, i.e., c \u2265 (ln 2)/2). Hence the expected delay per unit horizontal advance blows up as c\u2192\u221e, and the asymptotic speed v(c), which is roughly the reciprocal of this expected time per unit distance, goes to 0.\n\nAnswer: 0\n\nConfidence: 80%",

For each edge e = vj \u2212 vi we take the two hyperplanes through vi and vj perpendicular to e; together they form a slab of (signed) width equal to |e| (the distance between the two hyperplanes).\n\nLower bound:\n- Fix a vertex, say v0, and set ei = vi \u2212 v0 (i=1,\u2026,d). Consider the d slabs perpendicular to e1,\u2026,ed through v0 and vi. Their intersection is a parallelotope Q.\n- The linear map A: x \u21a6 (e1\u00b7x,\u2026,ed\u00b7x) has Jacobian |detA| = |det[e1 \u2026 ed]| = d! V. Under A, Q maps to the axis-parallel box \u220fi[0,||ei||^2]. Hence\n  Vol(Q) = (\u220fi ||ei||^2) / (d! V).\n- By the Hadamard inequality, |det[e1 \u2026 ed]| \u2264 \u220fi ||ei||, i.e., \u220fi ||ei||^2 \u2265 (d! V)^2. Therefore Vol(Q) \u2265 d! V.\n- The full polytope P is obtained by intersecting Q with the remaining edge-slabs, so Vol(P) \u2264 Vol(Q). However, there exist simplices for which those extra slabs are redundant: if T is a \u201cright\u201d (orthogonal) simplex (the edges e1,\u2026,ed are pairwise orthogonal), then the additional edge-slabs do not cut Q, hence P = Q and Vol(P) = d! V. For any non-orthogonal simplex, Q is strictly larger while the extra slabs cut it down; in all cases the intersection never drops below d! V. Thus the minimal possible value is d! V, attained (for example) by a right simplex.\n\nNo upper bound:\n- In 2D, fix V and take the triangle with vertices A=(0,0), B=(1,0), C=(t, 2V). A direct computation shows that the intersection P of the three strips has area\n  Area(P) = ( (t \u2212 1)^2 + (2V)^2 ) / (2V) \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e.\n- In higher dimensions, a similar construction (keeping a (d\u22121)-face fixed and moving the remaining vertex far along a direction nearly parallel to that face while adjusting the height to keep volume V) makes Vol(P) arbitrarily large.\n\nTherefore, as T ranges over all non-degenerate d-simplices of fixed volume V, the possible volumes of P form the unbounded interval [d! V, \u221e).\n\nAnswer: The set of possible volumes is [d! V, \u221e).\n\nConfidence: 64%",

The 300 kDa peak is B2. The 210 kDa peak matches A2 + C + D (50 + 60 + 100 = 210), indicating unphosphorylated A2 binds both C and D while B2 remains free.\n- Exp 3 (with kinase that phosphorylates A): peaks at 25, 40, and 460 kDa. The 25 kDa peak is A monomer (phosphorylation disrupts A dimer). The 40 kDa peak is free kinase. The 460 kDa peak matches B2 + C + D (300 + 60 + 100), showing that upon A phosphorylation, A no longer binds C/D and C/D now bind B2.\n- Exp 4 (A dephosphorylated afterward): peaks at 50 kDa (A2 restored) and 460 kDa (B2 + C + D remains). Thus, dephosphorylated A does not (under these conditions) displace C/D from B2. Hence we cannot claim that nonphosphorylated A \u201calways\u201d has higher affinity than B, nor that A \u201calways\u201d exists as a homodimer.\n- The data support: phosphorylation of A decreases its affinity for C/D; A exists as monomer or homodimer depending on phosphorylation. No option states this correctly without extra incorrect assertions (e.g., \u201calways\u201d homodimer, or invoking phosphorylation of B).\n\nAnswer: J.

For each M, the minimal polynomial \u03c0_M divides \u03c7_M, and \u03c0_M = \u03c7_M if and only if M is cyclic (nonderogatory), i.e., has a cyclic vector.\n\n- Continuity at cyclic M: If M is cyclic, pick a cyclic vector v so that {v, Mv, \u2026, M^{n\u22121}v} is a basis.

This gives the lower bound h \u2265 1/(2n \u2212 1).\n\nThis bound is tight: construct G by taking two \u201calmost cubic\u201d graphs on 2n \u2212 1 and 2n + 1 vertices where all vertices have degree 3 except one vertex of degree 2 in each, and connect these two degree-2 vertices by a single edge (a bridge). For example, start from the odd cycles C_{2n\u22121} and C_{2n+1} and add a near-perfect matching in each to make all but one vertex degree 3. Joining the unmatched degree-2 vertices yields a connected 3-regular graph on 4n vertices with a bridge splitting the graph into parts of sizes 2n \u2212 1 and 2n + 1. Taking U to be the side of size 2n \u2212 1 gives e(U,V \\ U)=1 and h = 1/(2n \u2212 1).\n\nHence the minimal possible Cheeger constant is 1/(2n \u2212 1).\n\nAnswer: 1/(2n \u2212 1)\n\nConfidence: 94%",

Within each unit square [m,m+1)\u00d7[n,n+1), the minimum of |z| occurs at (m,n) and equals r, so the condition \u230a|z|\u230b = r is equivalent (up to a boundary of measure zero) to |z| < r+1.

For m \u2265 9 we have F_m \u2265 34 > 26. Thus for m \u2265 9, either:\n  (i) a = b = c = d = e = f = 0, hence P(F_m) = 0; or\n  (ii) |P(F_m)| \u2265 F_m and P(F_m) is a nonzero multiple of F_m.\n\n- If (i) holds, the equation reduces to F_n + g = 0 with g \u2208 [\u221225,25].

Indeed, the equality F_n + P(F_m) + g = 0 with |g| \u2264 25 forces F_n \u2248 |P(F_m)|, and because P(F_m) is a polynomial in F_m of degree j \u2208 {1,\u2026,6} with bounded integer coefficients, while F_n grows like a constant times F_m^j where the constant is an irrational number depending on j and n mod m (by Binet\u2019s formula), one cannot have |F_n + P(F_m)| \u2264 25 for all large m unless the leading coefficient cancels that irrational constant, which is impossible with an integer coefficient. Consequently, for each fixed nonzero (a,\u2026,f), there are only finitely many m (hence finitely many pairs (m,n)) producing a solution. Summed over the finitely many choices of (a,\u2026,f) (namely 51^6 of them), these extra solutions contribute only O(1) to p(N).\n\n- Therefore p(N) = 9N + O(1), and the limit is\n  lim_{N\u2192\u221e} p(N)/N = 9.\n\nAnswer: 9\n\nConfidence: 78%",

Hence n(N) \u2273 N^{1/3}.\n\nConversely, for any measurable compact X with \u03bc(X)=1/N, Steinhaus\u2019 theorem implies XX^{-1} contains a neighborhood of the identity, and on a 3-dimensional Lie group, repeated products of a neighborhood expand roughly additively in radius and thus cubically in volume. Among sets of given measure, a small ball is the slowest to grow under products (isoperimetric/Brunn\u2013Minkowski-type heuristics via the Lie algebra for small scales). Therefore, after O(N^{1/3}) products, the volume reaches 1, forcing X^n=G (since a compact subset of full measure must be all of G). This matches the lower bound up to constants, so the correct exponent is 1/3.\n\nAnswer: \u03b1 = 1/3\n\nConfidence: 65%",

Because no proper subcontinuum contains any three points of S, one checks that\nX = \u22c3{K(p,q) : {p,q} \u2286 S, p \u2260 q}.\nIndeed, if some x \u2208 X were outside that union, then for any triple {u,v,w} \u2286 S the union K(u,v) \u222a K(v,w) \u222a K(u,w) would be a proper subcontinuum containing u,v,w yet missing x, contradicting the hypothesis.\n\nNow consider a cover X = A1 \u222a \u2026 \u222a An by subcontinua with each Ai \\ \u22c3_{j\u2260i} Aj \u2260 \u2205. No Ai can be all of X (otherwise all other sets would have empty \u201cexclusive part\u201d), so every Ai is a proper subcontinuum and thus meets S in at most two points. If Ai contains two points p,q \u2208 S, then by minimality K(p,q) \u2286 Ai. If Ai meets S in fewer than two points, it cannot contain any K(p,q).\n\nSince X is the union of the ten pair-continua K(p,q), each Ai with nonempty exclusive part must contain at least one such K(p,q); and a proper Ai can contain at most one (if it contained two disjoint pairs from S, it would contain at least three points of S and hence be all of X). Therefore the number of Ai\u2019s is bounded by the number of unordered pairs from S, namely C(5,2) = 10.\n\nThis bound is sharp: one can arrange a continuum X with five points S and choose the ten sets Ai to be the ten pair-continua K(p,q); their union is X and, by arranging them minimally/irreducibly between pairs, each has a nonempty part not covered by the others.\n\nAnswer: 10\nConfidence: 58%",

A (forward or backward) move on three consecutive collinear cells {x, x+e, x+2e} (e horizontal or vertical) toggles exactly those three cells; algebraically it adds the vector 111 on that triple. Thus two configurations are equivalent iff their difference lies in the span of all such \u201ctriple\u201d vectors.\n\nAny F2-linear functional L on configurations of the form L(f) = \u03a3 w(i,j) f(i,j) that vanishes on every triple-vector is an invariant of the equivalence relation. The condition \u201cvanishes on every triple\u201d is exactly:\n- along every row: w(i,j) + w(i+1,j) + w(i+2,j) = 0 for all i,j,\n- along every column: w(i,j) + w(i,j+1) + w(i,j+2) = 0 for all i,j.\n\nOver F2 this forces each row and column to satisfy the recurrence t_{n+2} = t_{n+1} + t_n, whose nonzero solutions have period 3. Consequently, w is 3-periodic in both directions and is determined by its values on a 2\u00d72 block; this gives a 4-dimensional space of invariants (choose w by prescribing w(0,0), w(1,0), w(0,1), w(1,1) \u2208 F2 and extending via the recurrence). Hence there are at least 2^4 = 16 distinct equivalence classes.\n\nConversely, one can \u201csweep\u201d any finite configuration by legal moves so that on each row all pegs are moved into the first two columns mod 3, and then on each column into the first two rows mod 3. This reduces any configuration, within its equivalence class, to a subset of a fixed 2\u00d72 block, and the four remaining bits equal precisely the four mod-2 invariants above. Therefore these four invariants completely classify configurations, and there are exactly 16 equivalence classes.\n\nAnswer: 16\n\nConfidence: 78%",

With the \u201cat least L\u201d lower bound per cluster, feasibility for k requires kL \u2264 n.\n- A local maximum at k requires score(k) = 2 while both neighbors have score 1. It is impossible for k = 2, because if a 2-center solution with score 1 exists, then adding any third admissible center that can hold at least L points also yields a 3-center score 1 (the two centers that already cover S can offload L points to the third while keeping all distances \u2264 1).

One can construct 1\u20132 metrics on n = 5L points that realize the local-max at k = 4 (so N = 120), but we only need N\u2019s minimality and k = 4 for the overlap bound.\n- Let A be an optimal (k\u22121)-clustering and B an optimal (k+1)-clustering on n = N points, with every cluster having size at least L.

Plugging a = k\u22121 = 3 and b = k+1 = 5:\n  \u2022 n/(ab) = 120/(3\u00b75) = 8\n  \u2022 L/(k+1) = 24/5 = 4.8 \u2192 5\n  \u2022 L/(k\u22121) = 24/3 = 8\n  Hence any such instance must have a pair of clusters (one from the optimal 3-clustering and one from the optimal 5-clustering) that overlap in at least max{8, 5, 8} = 8 points.\n- This lower bound is tight: with n = 5L and k = 4, one can arrange the two optimal partitions so that overlaps are as even as constraints allow, keeping the maximum intersection down to 8. Therefore the minimum possible w_C across all minimal-size local-max instances is 8.\n\nAnswer: 8\n\nConfidence: 62%",

If G is nonabelian and filled, known results on filled groups force P to be cyclic of order q (so m = 1); otherwise one can construct a maximal product-free set that does not fill G. Thus the only candidates are the nonabelian groups of order 2q, which are the dihedral groups D_{2q}. Among dihedral groups, the filled ones are known to be only D6, D8, D10, D12, and D14; restricting to orders 2q^m with q odd eliminates D8 and D12. Hence the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m are precisely D6 (\u2245 S3), D10, and D14, i.e., when m = 1 and q \u2208 {3, 5, 7}. No examples occur for m \u2265 2 or for q \u2265 11.\nAnswer: Exactly the dihedral groups D6 (S3), D10, and D14.\nConfidence: 85%",

With surface-active elements (e.g., sulfur/oxygen) common in 304 SS, the surface tension can increase with temperature (positive d\u03b3/dT), making the hot center have higher surface tension than the cooler edges. Fluid on the surface flows from low to high surface tension, i.e., from the outer cooler regions inward toward the hot center. Arc drag and arc pressure typically drive outward surface flow, buoyancy drives vertical convection, and Lorentz forces primarily affect bulk flow patterns rather than producing the observed inward surface surface flow. The observed inward surface flow thus indicates Marangoni-driven convection.\nAnswer: A. Marangoni Force\nConfidence: 78%",

In any graph with maximum degree \u0394, the strong chromatic index \u03c7\u2032_s(G) is at most 2\u0394^2 \u2212 2\u0394 + 1, so the largest induced matching has size at least m / (2\u0394^2 \u2212 2\u0394 + 1), where m is the number of edges. Unbounded treewidth implies the class contains graphs with arbitrarily many vertices (and hence edges in some component), so this lower bound yields induced matchings of arbitrarily large size across the class.\n- E: False. By the Kostochka\u2013Thomason theorem, a K_t minor requires average degree \u03a9(t \u221alog t). With maximum degree bounded by a constant d, the clique-minor size is bounded by a function of d, so it cannot be unbounded.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nConfidence: 94%",

Disjoint union makes a commutative monoid with identity the empty graph, and the tensor product is associative and commutative, distributes over disjoint union, and the empty graph is absorbing.

            "response": "Explanation: \n- Step 1 (KOtBu, cyclohexane/Et2O): A strong, bulky base promotes E2 elimination of the secondary bromide. Two \u03b2-positions are available (C2 and C4), but tert-butoxide favors abstraction of the less hindered \u03b2-hydrogen (H on the methyl at C4), giving the less substituted (Hofmann) alkene. Flexible anti-periplanar geometry allows E2 to proceed, and the stereocenter at C3 is destroyed. Product A = 4-phenyl-1-butene (Ph\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH=CH2).\n- Step 2 (BH3\u00b7THF, then H2O2/NaOH): Hydroboration\u2013oxidation adds across the alkene in a syn, anti-Markovnikov fashion. Boron adds to the terminal carbon, then oxidation replaces B with OH to give the primary alcohol. Product B = 4-phenyl-1-butanol (Ph\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2OH).\n- Step 3 (PBr3): Converts the primary alcohol to the primary bromide via formation of a phosphite and SN2 displacement by bromide. The reacting carbon is not stereogenic, so inversion is not stereochemically consequential. Product C = 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (Ph\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2Br).\n\nChirality: The initial (3S) stereocenter is removed during the E2 elimination (step 1) to form an achiral alkene. Neither hydroboration\u2013oxidation nor the PBr3 substitution introduces a new stereocenter, so the final product C is achiral.\n\nAnswer: C = 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (IUPAC: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane; also called (4-bromobutyl)benzene). It is achiral because the stereocenter present in the starting material is destroyed in the first step and no new stereocenter is created subsequently.\n\nConfidence: 90%",

The doubling map d: G\u2192G, d(x)=2x is a homomorphism with kernel G[2] (the 2-torsion subgroup) and image 2G. Hence every element y\u22082G has exactly |G[2]| preimages, and elements outside 2G have none. Therefore\n|k(S)| = |d^{-1}(S)| = |G[2]| \u00b7 |S\u22292G|.\nThe inequality |k(S)| > 2|S| becomes\n|G[2]| \u00b7 |S\u22292G| > 2|S|.\nIn particular, we must have |G[2]| \u2265 4. One quickly checks:\n- |G|=4 (C2\u00d7C2) and |G|=8 with exponent 2 are impossible since 0\u2209S for sum-free S, giving k(S)=\u2205.\n- For |G|=8 with G\u2245C4\u00d7C2, |G[2]|=4 and |2G|=2 (one nonzero element in 2G). Any inclusion-maximal sum-free S has |S\u22292G|=1 and |S|=2, giving |k(S)|=4=2|S| (not strict).\n- For |G|=12 (e.g., C6\u00d7C2), |G[2]|=4 but 2G\u2245C3. A sum-free S cannot contain both nonzero elements of 2G (since x+x=2x would hit the other), so |S\u22292G|\u22641; singletons are not maximal. Hence strict inequality is impossible.\n- For all groups of order 16 with |G[2]|\u22654, one can show the best one can do for inclusion-maximal sum-free S is equality |k(S)|=2|S| (typical example: G=C4\u00d7C4 where any maximal sum-free S has |S|\u22654 and |S\u22292G|\u22642, giving |k(S)|=4\u00b72=8=2\u00b74).\n\nTo make |k(S)|>2|S| feasible, we need either larger |G[2]| (to relax the right-hand side) or a larger proportion |S\u22292G|/|S|. The smallest order where one can achieve strict inequality with an inclusion-maximal sum-free set is |G|=32. For example, take\nG = C4 \u00d7 C4 \u00d7 C2,\nso |G|=32, |G[2]|=8, and 2G\u2245C2\u00d7C2 (hence has three nonzero elements). One can construct an inclusion-maximal sum-free set S\u2286G with\n- |S\u22292G|=2 (choose two of the three nonzero elements of 2G),\n- |S|=7 (the set can be extended carefully by elements whose doubles hit the remaining nonzero of 2G, while preserving sum-freeness, until it is maximal).\nThen |k(S)|=|G[2]|\u00b7|S\u22292G|=8\u00b72=16 and 2|S|=14, so |k(S)|>2|S| holds.\n\nSmaller orders fail for the reasons above: for |G|\u226416, either |G[2]| is too small or structural constraints on 2G force |S\u22292G| so small that any inclusion-maximal S cannot meet the strict inequality.\n\nAnswer: 32\n\nConfidence: 38%",

It is aposyndetic: for any two distinct points x,y, one can choose a closed subinterval K that contains x in its interior (relative to [0,1]) and avoids y. Now examine non-block points in [0,1]. If p is an interior point, then [0,1] \\ {p} splits into two disjoint open subintervals, so any continuum-connected subset must lie in one component and cannot be dense in the whole complement, hence p is a block point. If p is an endpoint (0 or 1), then [0,1] \\ {p} is connected and indeed continuum-connected (any two points are contained in a compact subinterval within the complement), so each endpoint is a non-block point. Thus [0,1] has exactly two non-block points, showing the minimal possible cardinality is \u2264 2. One cannot do better (i.e., get only one) in the aposyndetic class, and the interval realizes the minimum. Therefore the smallest possible cardinality is 2.\n\nAnswer: 2\n\nConfidence: 85%",

A vertex of odd degree can be handled by first adding one auxiliary edge incident to it (to make its degree even), then splitting off. Here deg(v1)=d is even, and deg(v2)=deg(v3)=d+1 are odd. Add one auxiliary edge between v2 and v3, making both even. Then split off v1, v2, v3. This produces a 2-edge-connected graph on V \\ {v1,v2,v3} with exactly d/2 + (d+2)/2 + (d+2)/2 = (3d+4)/2 new edges among the remaining vertices. Hence (3d+4)/2 edges always suffice.\n- Lower bound: Deleting a vertex of degree m from a 2-edge-connected graph creates at least m \u201cports\u201d at its neighbors that must be paired by added edges to avoid creating a bridge; each added edge can serve at most two ports, so at least \u2308m/2\u2309 new edges are necessary per deleted vertex. Summing over v1,v2,v3 gives d/2 + \u2308(d+1)/2\u2309 + \u2308(d+1)/2\u2309 = d/2 + (d/2+1) + (d/2+1) = (3d+4)/2. Therefore no fewer edges can suffice.\n\nCombining both bounds, the minimal number is (3d+4)/2.\n\nAnswer: (3d + 4)/2\n\nConfidence: 86%",

A standard 2-adic divisibility fact for n=4 shows that after every 4 steps all entries gain at least one extra factor of 2; in particular, after 4k steps, every entry is divisible by 2^k. Because all entries always remain between 0 and the initial maximum, once 2^k exceeds that bound, the only possible values are 0, so the sequence must be all zeros at or before step 4k.\n\nWith 0 \u2264 a,b,c,d \u2264 10,000,000, the smallest k with 2^k > 10,000,000 is k=24 (since 2^23=8,388,608 and 2^24=16,777,216). Hence any sequence must be zero by step 96, so the maximum possible number of squares drawn is M = 96 + 1 = 97 (counting the initial square). This upper bound is tight; there exist initial 4-tuples that attain exactly one new factor of 2 every block of 4 steps, reaching zero precisely at step 96.\n\nAmong those that achieve this maximum, one can choose a tuple with minimal possible sum by taking the maximal entry as small as allowed by the bound-driving argument (namely 2^23) and arranging the other entries to avoid any \u201caccelerated\u201d factor-of-2 gains. For such maximizers, a necessary congruence that persists along the extremal chain forces a+b\u2212c\u2212d \u2261 0 modulo 2^3 and modulo 5^3 (hence modulo 1000).

To pass from one section to an orthogonally adjacent section, the water surface must reach at least the smaller of the two depths (the \u201csill\u201d of that edge). Thus, the earliest h at which a cell is reached equals the minimax over paths of the maximum edge-sill along the path. This can be computed by a Dijkstra-like process with edge weight w(u,v)=min(depth(u),depth(v)) and path cost as the maximum of used edge weights.\n\nCompute this \u201cthreshold\u201d f for the four neighbors of 43:\n- 49 (6,7): f(49)=20, edge sill min(49,43)=43 \u2192 candidate 43\n- 34 (3,7): f(34)=18, edge sill min(34,43)=34 \u2192 candidate 34\n- 36 (7,6): f(36)=17, edge sill min(36,43)=36 \u2192 candidate 36\n- 20 (5,7): f(20)=18, edge sill min(20,43)=20 \u2192 candidate 20\n\nThe minimum is 20, achieved via neighbor 20.

Summing (depth \u2212 20) over the included cells with depth > 20 gives V(20) = 363 ft\u00b3.

Denatured MS in positive mode gives the same protein mass for both samples, ruling out covalent modifications. In negative mode, a ~1,500 Da species (consistent with cardiolipin) is detected only for the OG sample, indicating co-purified anionic lipid. Exchanging the OG sample into CHAPS collapses the trimer back to monomer, showing CHAPS strips the lipid and alters oligomerization.

The portion of \u2202A between t_i (on side i) and t_{i+1} (on side i+1) lies inside the triangle with apex V_i and base the segment t_i t_{i+1}. Hence, the farthest point of B from A near that corner is V_i, and its distance to A is at most the perpendicular distance from V_i to the line through t_i t_{i+1}.\n\nIf x is the distance from V_i to t_i along side i and y is the distance from V_i to t_{i+1} along side i+1 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 a_i, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 a_{i+1}), then by elementary triangle geometry that distance equals:\nd_i(x,y) = (x y sin \u03c6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 2 x y cos \u03c6).\n\nHowever, the point t_i is shared by the two adjacent corners V_{i-1} and V_i, so if its distance from V_i along side i is x, its distance from V_{i-1} along the same side is a_i - x. To maximize the maximum corner-cut distance over all corners simultaneously, one must \u201cbalance\u201d these competing uses of t_i. The optimal choice is x = a_i/2 on every side, i.e., take each tangency point at the midpoint of the corresponding side. This gives for corner V_i:\nd_i(max) = d_i(a_i/2, a_{i+1}/2) = (a_i a_{i+1} sin \u03c6) / (2 b_i),\nwhere b_i = sqrt(a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 + 2 a_i a_{i+1} cos \u03c6) is the length of the segment between the midpoints of sides i and i+1.\n\nThus the worst-case Hausdorff distance between A and B is attained by the \u201cmidpoint polygon\u201d (the convex hull of the midpoints of the sides of B), and equals the maximum over corners of the above distances.\n\nAnswer: d_H(A,B) = max_{i=1,\u2026,n} (a_i a_{i+1} sin \u03c6) / (2 b_i), with \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/n and b_i = sqrt(a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 + 2 a_i a_{i+1} cos \u03c6).\n\nConfidence: 74%",

Hydrostatic pressure gives \u03c1 g \u03be opposing this lift, and surface tension contributes a Laplace pressure of order 2\u03b3/s that also opposes the rise (for a nearly flat meniscus between parallel plates).

The interface becomes unstable when the electrostatic \u201cstiffness\u201d (\u221d \u03b50 V0^2/(s \u2212 \u03be)^3) exceeds the restoring contributions from gravity (\u03c1 g) and surface tension, leading to a loss of equilibrium and runaway growth; this aligns with the qualitative instability statement provided.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nConfidence: 60%",

The nonlinearity and temperature modify \u03bc via \u03bc(B,T) \u2248 \u03bc0 (1 \u2212 \u03b1T (T1 \u2212 T0)) / (1 + B/Bs). Approximating the saturation term using the unsaturated DC field B \u2248 (\u03bc0 N0 I0 / g) gives an effective \u03bceff \u2248 \u03bc0 (1 \u2212 \u03b1T (T1 \u2212 T0)) / (1 + \u03bc0 N0 I0 /(g Bs)).

Although a strict derivation gives a 1/g dependence (not 1/g^2), D is the only option with the correct saturation sign and temperature dependence.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nConfidence: 62%",

Such a pattern has:\n- either the face-center red (then center red, 2 opposite corners red, 0 edges red), or\n- the face-center green (then 1 corner red and 2 edges red).\n\nLet f be the number of faces whose center is red. Counting red occurrences over all faces (6 faces, 3 reds per face = 18 occurrences) by cube type:\n- corners: each red corner appears on 3 faces, and per-face contributes 2 (if center red) or 1 (if center green). Thus 3a = 2f + (6 \u2212 f) = 6 + f \u21d2 a = (6 + f)/3, so f must be 0, 3, or 6, giving a = 2, 3, or 4.\n- edges: each red edge appears on 2 faces, and per-face contributes 0 (if center red) or 2 (if center green). Thus 2b = 0\u00b7f + 2(6 \u2212 f) = 12 \u2212 2f \u21d2 b = 6 \u2212 f.\n- face-centers: c = f.\n\nHence the number of distinct red surface cubes is\na + b + c = (6 + f)/3 + (6 \u2212 f) + f = 8 + f/3,\nso it can be 8 (f=0), 9 (f=3), or 10 (f=6). The interior cube is unconstrained and can be red or green, adding 0 or 1 to the total number of reds.\n\nTherefore the total number of red cubes can be 8, 9, 10, or 11, so the total number of green cubes (27 minus reds) can be 19, 18, 17, or 16. All three f-cases are realizable (e.g., f=6: all face centers red with consistent face diagonals gives 4 red corners, no red edges; f=0: two opposite body-diagonal corners red and the six appropriate nonadjacent face edges red; f=3: mix three adjacent faces of each type), so these bounds are tight.\n\nAnswer: Smallest possible number of green cubes = 16; largest possible number of green cubes = 19.\n\nConfidence: 86%",

This yields an equivalent existential formula whose witnesses range over N and whose matrix is a finite Boolean combination of polynomial equations/inequations with integer coefficients and P-constraints.\n\nBy the Matiyasevich\u2013DPRM theorem, subsets of N definable by existential formulas using only addition and multiplication (i.e., Diophantine sets) are exactly the recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets; moreover, basic recursive relations such as t \u2260 0, divisibility, boundedness, etc., are themselves Diophantine, so the presence of inequations and P-atoms does not increase expressive power beyond r.e. Conversely, every r.e. subset of N is Diophantine, hence definable by an existential L-formula in this structure (using P to restrict the quantified variables to N; parameters 0,1 can be supplied since arbitrary real parameters are allowed). Allowing arbitrary real parameters does not enlarge the class beyond r.e. when the free variable is restricted to N, as the real coefficients can be reduced to integer-coefficient conditions once variables are constrained to be natural.\n\nTherefore, the subsets of N definable by existential L-formulas (with parameters) are exactly the recursively enumerable sets.\n\nAnswer: D. recursively enumerable subsets of N\n\nConfidence: 78%",

In the strong-loss (quantum Zeno) regime, dynamics is projected into the dark subspace with no double occupancy. This suppresses any single-particle tunneling process that would create a doublon (\u201cdissipative blockade\u201d), so effective tunneling that leads to losses vanishes, and the losses themselves cease at long times (zero losses). Because only spin-singlet doublons can exist on a single site for fermions, the loss selectively removes singlet components and thereby favors triplet character, leading to ferromagnetic-like spin correlations and spin entanglement in the surviving state. There is no reason for the particle number to go to zero in general; once in the dark subspace, particles can persist without further loss, so \u201czero particles\u201d is not a generic long-time property.

Thus the sum on the left is bounded by a constant times the sum on the right.

Thus an arrangement admits no legal move if and only if every empty cell has either 0 or at least 2 occupied neighbors. Call such an arrangement \u201cfrozen.\u201d\n\nWe seek the largest k such that every placement of k diamonds admits a legal move. Equivalently, let s_min be the minimum number of diamonds in any frozen arrangement; then the answer is k = s_min \u2212 1.\n\nUpper bound (show s_min \u2265 2024^2/4):\nPartition the 2024\u00d72024 board into (2024/2)^2 = 2024^2/4 disjoint 2\u00d72 blocks. For any frozen arrangement S, in each 2\u00d72 block let x be the number of occupied black squares and y the number of occupied white squares (so x,y \u2208 {0,1,2} and x+y \u2264 2 by independence).\n\n- Consider the two white squares in a block. If a white square is empty and there are x occupied black squares in the block, then it needs at least max(0, 2 \u2212 x) occupied black neighbors outside the block to avoid having exactly 1 neighbor. Summing the minimum required outside contributions over the two white squares in the block and adding the x inside blacks, the block\u2019s \u201cblack support\u201d contribution is at least 2; moreover, summing these minimal outside contributions over all blocks is at most the total number of cross-block adjacencies from occupied black squares, which is 2 per occupied black. Hence sum over blocks of this \u201cblack support\u201d \u2264 2|S_black|.\n\n- By symmetry, doing the same for empty black squares relative to occupied whites yields a \u201cwhite support\u201d sum over all blocks \u2264 2|S_white|, and per block it is at least 2 as well.\n\nSumming both supports over all blocks gives at least 2 per block, i.e., at least 2\u00b7(2024^2/4) = 2024^2/2, while it is at most 2(|S_black| + |S_white|) = 2|S|. Therefore |S| \u2265 2024^2/4. Thus s_min \u2265 2024^2/4.\n\nLower bound (construction with exactly 2024^2/4 diamonds and no move):\nPlace a diamond on every cell with both coordinates even (one specific quarter of the board). This is an independent set. Every white cell (odd sum of coordinates) has exactly two occupied neighbors (never exactly one), and the remaining empty black cells have 0 occupied neighbors. Hence no empty cell has exactly one occupied neighbor, so this arrangement is frozen with exactly 2024^2/4 diamonds.\n\nTherefore s_min = 2024^2/4, and the largest k for which every arrangement of k diamonds admits a legal move is k = 2024^2/4 \u2212 1.\n\nNumerically, 2024^2 = 4,096,576, so 2024^2/4 = 1,024,144 and k = 1,024,143.\n\nAnswer: 1,024,143\n\nConfidence: 90%",

For bounded degree graphs this removes a constant fraction of the graph per round, so O(log n) rounds suffice with high probability.\n\n- Upper bound: On a cycle (degree 2), a vertex with two neighbors survives a round iff none of it nor its two neighbors is a local maximum; this occurs with probability exactly 2/15. If it becomes an endpoint, survival per round is 1/6. Thus, for any remaining vertex on a path/cycle, survival per round \u2264 1/6, so the probability any vertex survives t rounds is \u2264 n\u00b7(1/6)^t. Taking t = \u0398(log n) makes this \u2264 1/n. The standard Luby analysis gives the same O(log n) whp bound for any graph with maximum degree \u0394 \u2264 100 (constant removal probability per round depending only on \u0394).\n\n- Lower bound: On a cycle (and thus in any tree or graph containing many disjoint paths), consider vertices spaced \u2265 8 apart. For any such vertex v, the event \u201cno peaks at positions v\u22122,\u2026,v+2\u201d in a round (which has probability 2^{6}/7! > 0) guarantees v and its two neighbors all remain that round. Across t rounds these events are independent, so v survives t rounds with probability at least c^t for some constant c \u2208 (0,1). With \u0398(n) independent candidates, the probability that all die by time t is \u2248 exp(\u2212\u0398(n c^t)), which remains \u2265 1/n unless t = \u0398(log n). Hence \u03a9(log n) rounds are necessary (for 1 \u2212 1/n success) on cycles, and the same lower bound carries over to trees and bounded-degree graphs by embedding disjoint paths.\n\nCombining, for all three families the finishing time is \u0398(log n) with probability 1 \u2212 1/n, which falls into category 9.\n\nAnswer: 999\nConfidence: 85%",

Therefore |G| \u2265 12\u00b7|A11| = |A12|, but G \u2264 A12 (all generators are even), so G = A12.\n- The Schur multiplier of A_n is C2 for n \u2265 8 (with small exceptions not including n=12). Hence A = M(G) \u2245 C2.\n- The proper subgroups of C2 are only the trivial subgroup. Up to isomorphism, there is exactly one.\n\nAnswer: 1\n\nConfidence: 88%",

            "response": "Explanation: \nA clean way to get two-round (indeed, one-response) threshold signing with a tight security reduction is to build on BLS signatures and Shamir secret sharing with a robust distributed key generation (DKG). BLS signatures admit tight security proofs in the random-oracle model under standard pairing assumptions, and thresholdizing BLS is simple and black-box: partial signatures are homomorphic and combine via Lagrange interpolation exponents. Unlike Schnorr- or ECDSA-based threshold signatures, there is no per-signature nonce to coordinate, so the online signing phase is just \u201crequest then respond,\u201d i.e., two rounds.\n\nHigh-level design:\n- Setup:\n  - Choose a pairing-friendly setting with prime-order groups G1, G2, GT of order q, generators g1 \u2208 G1, g2 \u2208 G2, and a bilinear map e: G1 \u00d7 G2 \u2192 GT.\n  - Let H: {0,1}* \u2192 G1 be a hash-to-curve function (IETF RFC 9380 compliant).\n- DKG (t-out-of-n):\n  - Run a UC-secure robust DKG (e.g., Pedersen/Feldman-style VSS-based DKG adapted to pairings) so that the secret signing key x \u2208 Z_q is never reconstructed, but each party i learns a share s_i = f(i) for a random degree-(t\u22121) polynomial f with f(0) = x.\n  - Publish the group public key X = g2^x in G2. Each party also gets a verifiable public verification share Y_i = g2^{s_i} derivable from DKG commitments so partial signatures can be locally verified.\n  - This DKG stage prevents rogue-key attacks and guarantees consistency of shares.\n- Two-round signing for any message m:\n  - Round 1 (request): A coordinator/aggregator selects a subset S \u2286 {1,\u2026,n}, |S| \u2265 t, and broadcasts m and the identities/indices of S (or parties agree on S via an application-layer protocol).\n  - Round 2 (respond):\n    - Each i \u2208 S computes a partial BLS signature \u03c3_i = H(m)^{s_i} \u2208 G1 and returns \u03c3_i (optionally with a short proof or simply allow the aggregator to verify via pairings).\n    - The aggregator verifies each partial: e(\u03c3_i, g2) ?= e(H(m), Y_i). Invalid or missing shares are dropped; as long as at least t valid partials arrive, proceed.\n    - Compute Lagrange coefficients \u03bb_i(S) over Z_q for the x-coordinates at points i \u2208 S.\n    - Combine to the full signature: \u03c3 = \u220f_{i\u2208S} \u03c3_i^{\u03bb_i(S)} = H(m)^{\u2211 \u03bb_i s_i} = H(m)^x.\n  - Output (\u03c3, X). Verification: check e(\u03c3, g2) ?= e(H(m), X).\n- Security and tightness:\n  - Unforgeability of BLS is known with tight reductions in the ROM in the multi-user setting; the threshold transformation is black-box: any forger against the threshold scheme yields a forger against base BLS with at most a small, essentially linear overhead (no forking-lemma loss).\n  - The DKG ensures that all verification shares Y_i are consistent with the same secret key x, preventing rogue-key attacks and enabling public verification of partials.\n  - Robustness: the aggregator can exclude faulty signers; any t valid partials suffice for reconstruction.\n- Practical notes:\n  - Use a modern pairing curve (e.g., BLS12-381) and standardized hash-to-curve.\n  - Fix unique, public indices for parties to compute Lagrange coefficients deterministically.\n  - If a trusted dealer is acceptable, replace DKG with dealer-based Shamir sharing and Feldman commitments; you still retain two-round signing.\n  - If you specifically need DL-based (no pairings) two-round threshold signatures, consider Schnorr/FROST; however, known proofs are not tight (e.g., forking-lemma style). Tightness is the reason BLS is preferred here.\n\nAnswer: Use a threshold BLS design: run a robust DKG to share a BLS secret key x via Shamir sharing (degree t\u22121) with publicly verifiable commitments yielding public key X = g2^x and verification shares Y_i = g2^{s_i}. For signing, do two rounds: (1) coordinator broadcasts the message and selected signers S; (2) each selected signer returns a partial \u03c3_i = H(m)^{s_i}, which the coordinator verifies and combines with Lagrange exponents into \u03c3 = \u220f \u03c3_i^{\u03bb_i(S)} = H(m)^x. The final signature (\u03c3, X) verifies via e(\u03c3, g2) = e(H(m), X). Security is tightly reduced to the underlying BLS signature security in the ROM, while robustness and consistency come from the DKG.\n\nConfidence: 78%",

If released from rest with negligible initial radius (r0\u21920), this simplifies to v = \u221a[(8\u03c1g/(7\ud835\ude81ho)) r].\n- Using dr/dt = (\ud835\ude81ho/(4\u03c1)) v and integrating from top to bottom over a fall distance H gives a remarkably simple result in which \u03c1 and \ud835\ude81ho cancel: t = \u221a(14H/g).\n- For H = 350 m, t = \u221a(14\u00b7350/g) = \u221a(4900/g). Note that although the problem mentions \u03c1 and \ud835\ude81ho, they cancel out in the final fall time under these assumptions.\n\nAnswer: t = \u221a(4900/g) seconds (more generally, t = \u221a(14H/g)); the dependence on \u03c1 and \ud835\ude81ho cancels.\n\nConfidence: 0.64",

Each W\u2208X has codimension 23, and for a fixed 2000-dimensional V the condition \u2211_{W\u2208Y}(V\u2229W)=V is equivalent (by duality) to saying that in V*, the intersection of the subspaces Ann_V(V\u2229W) (W\u2208Y) is {0}. Equivalently, if for each W\u2208Y we choose 23 independent linear forms whose common kernel is W, then the 23|Y| restricted linear forms on V span V*. Thus the problem asks for the smallest m such that there exist m blocks of 23 global linear forms with the property that for every 2000-dimensional V, their restrictions to V span V*.\n\nUpper bound (existence for m=87): Over F_p with p>2023, there exist MDS (maximum-distance-separable) matrices of size 2001\u00d72023 (e.g., a Vandermonde/Generalized Reed\u2013Solomon parity-check matrix). Such a matrix H has rank 2001 and the property that any 2001 columns are linearly independent. Partition the 2001 rows into 87 blocks of 23 rows each. For each block b, let W_b be the common kernel of the 23 linear forms (rows) in that block; then W_b has codimension 23. Fix any 2000-dimensional V. The set of all 2001 rows restricts to 2001 linear forms on V; since V has dimension 2000, at least 2000 of these restrictions are linearly independent, hence the restricted rows span V*. Therefore the intersection of the 87 block-spans in V* is {0}, i.e., \u2211_b (V\u2229W_b)=V for every V. Hence m\u226487.\n\nLower bound (necessity of m\u226587): Consider the dual viewpoint. For each W\u2208Y, let U_W\u2282F^* be its 23-dimensional annihilator. If |Y|=m\u226486, then the sum S=\u2211_{W\u2208Y}U_W has dimension at most 23m\u22641978<2023. Choose a 23-dimensional subspace A\u2282S. For this A, one shows that \u2229_{W\u2208Y}(A+U_W) strictly contains A (since all A+U_W lie inside S and cannot intersect back to A alone when A\u2282S with dim S>dim A), which by the above dual equivalence yields a 2000-dimensional V with V^0=A for which \u2211_{W\u2208Y}(V\u2229W)\u2260V. Hence m cannot be \u226486. Therefore m\u226587.\n\nCombining, the minimal size is 87.\n\nAnswer: 87\n\nConfidence: 0.64",

This can be shown by a standard deletion/sampling argument together with KST-type bounds (supersaturation) which imply that the number of K_{k,k} copies is at most on the order of m^k, allowing one to delete a suitably small number of edges to eliminate all K_{k,k} while retaining \u03a9(m^{1\u22121/(2k)}) edges. Equivalently, this yields a universal lower bound f(m) \u2265 c_k m^{1\u22121/(2k)}.\n\nThese matching power laws give\nlim_{m\u2192\u221e} (ln f(m))/(ln m) = 1 \u2212 1/(2k).\n\nAnswer: 1 \u2212 1/(2k)\nConfidence: 65%",

For a fixed nonprincipal ultrafilter V, every ultrafilter U with U \u2264 V is of the form f(V) for some such f. There are only continuum many (i.e., 2^{aleph_0}) finite-to-one nondecreasing functions N \u2192 N, so there are at most continuum many U below V; hence any antichain below V has size \u2264 2^{aleph_0}.\n\nThis upper bound is sharp. One can construct, for any fixed nonprincipal V, a family {f_r : r \u2208 2^N} of finite-to-one nondecreasing maps such that the ultrafilters f_r(V) are pairwise incomparable in this order. Intuitively, view a finite-to-one nondecreasing map as induced by a partition of N into finite consecutive intervals; pushing V forward by such a map depends only on which unions of these intervals are V-large. By building a perfect family of such partitions whose induced Boolean algebras of interval-unions are pairwise incompatible modulo V (a standard Cantor-tree/diagonalization construction using the ultrafilter property to split at each stage), one gets a perfect antichain {f_r(V) : r \u2208 2^N}. Thus the largest possible cardinality of an antichain below V is exactly 2^{aleph_0}.\n\nAnswer: 2^{aleph_0} (the continuum)\n\nConfidence: 70%",

Under strong basic conditions (NaH), its phenoxide/diphenoxide is very air-sensitive and is readily oxidized by dissolved oxygen to the corresponding naphthoquinone, destroying the nucleophile before it can undergo O-alkylation. Running the deprotonation/alkylation under an inert atmosphere (degassed solvent, N2/Ar) is typically crucial for these systems. NaH and EtBr are otherwise suitable, and while DMF can help with solubility/reactivity, excluding oxygen is the key fix here.\nAnswer: C\nConfidence: 80%",

This adds 0.5\u03bb to the morphospecies extinction rate: \u03bc_morpho = \u03bc + 0.5\u03bb. Under the stated assumption that underlying process rates are the same and (to get a numeric factor) taking speciation and extinction rates to be equal (\u03bb = \u03bc), the morphospecies extinction rate becomes \u03bc + 0.5\u03bc = 1.5\u03bc.

Then A\u2192B and B\u2192(\u00acC \u2227 (A\u2228D)) are designated while A\u2192(\u00acC \u2227 A) has t=0.\n- K is valid: from A\u2227B designated, t(A)=t(B)=1; then (\u00acA\u2228\u00acB)\u2192(A\u2227B)=\u00ac(\u00acA\u2228\u00acB)\u2228(A\u2227B) has t\u2265t(A\u2227B)=1, so designated.\n- L is valid: assume A designated (t(A)=1). To make (A\u2227B)\u2192(B\u2227A)=\u00ac(A\u2227B)\u2228(B\u2227A) undesignated we would need both disjuncts with t=0, which is impossible in LP given t(A)=1 (there is no value with t=0 and f=0). Hence designated.\n\nFormulas:\n- B is valid in KG (and in classical K). To falsify both implications simultaneously would require \u25a1Fa true and \u25a1Ga true, with some accessible world where \u00acFa and \u25c7\u2203x(Fx\u2227Hx) are true. In classical K this is impossible (\u00acFa contradicts \u25a1Fa); in KG one might try to use gluts, but making the second implication false requires t(Fa)=0 at some accessible world, which forces f(Fa)=1 in LP, thereby making f(\u25a1Fa)=1 and so the first implication true. Thus both can\u2019t be false together; B is valid.\n- A is not valid: in a frame where a world has no accessible successors, all diamonds at that world have t=0, making A\u2019s big disjunction have t=0.\n- C is not valid (classical countermodel suffices): let wRv; at v take Aa true and Bx true for all x. Then \u25a1Aa is true at w, but at v the matrix \u2200x(\u00ac(\u00acAa\u2228\u00acBx)\u2192\u2203x\u00ac(Aa\u2227Bx)) is false, so \u25c7 of it is false; hence C false at w.\n- D is not valid: let wRv; at w set Ab,F and \u2200x(Cx\u2192Ba) false so the left conjunct \u00ac(...) true; at v make (\u00acCa\u2227Ab) true (e.g., Ab true, Ca false), but keep Ax false for all x so \u25c7\u2203x(\u00acCx\u2227Ax) is false. Then antecedent true, consequent false.\n- E is not valid: take wRv, and at v set P,Q true; let v have no successors so \u25a1(P\u2227\u00acQ) true. Then P\u2192((P\u2227Q)\u2228\u25a1(P\u2227\u00acQ)) is true at v, hence \u00ac(...) false at v; thus \u25a1\u00ac(...) false at w.\n- I is not valid: with A=B=C true (classical valuation), ((A\u2228B)\u2192C) is true while (\u00acA\u2228(\u00acB\u2227C)) is false; hence the whole is false.\n\nTherefore among formulas, only B is true; among arguments, K and L are valid; G is invalid. Consequently: \n- F (\u201cNone of them is true\u201d) is false because B is true. \n- H (\u201cNone of them is valid\u201d) is false because K and L are valid. \n- J (\u201cNeither of them is true or valid\u201d) is false for the same reason.\n\nAnswer: B, K, L\n\nConfidence: 63%",

Define P(S) as the number of edges between S and its complement (the \u201cedge boundary\u201d of S). When a new vertex becomes infected, it has at least 3 already infected neighbors. For an interior vertex (degree 4), this changes P by at most (+1) for its one healthy neighbor and at least (\u22123) for its three infected neighbors, so \u0394P \u2264 \u22122. For an edge (degree 3) newly infected, \u0394P \u2264 \u22123. Thus every new infection decreases P by at least 2.

On the incomplete 2-wide strips at the right and bottom, extend the same periodic pattern. In this configuration, each healthy site is eventually surrounded by three infected neighbors as the infection propagates inward block-by-block, so the entire grid becomes infected.

This bound is tight via the standard construction using bit partitions. For n = 35, ceil(log2 35) = 6.\nAnswer: 6\nConfidence: 90%",

You also need a fast low-R path during reset and extremely low leakage from the floating node. Among the options, the split-gate approach best balances these constraints:\n\n- Headroom and offset tolerance: By partitioning the channel into a bootstrapped portion and a statically biased portion, the effective conduction is an area-weighted combination of the two gate biases. This reduces how far the bootstrapped gate must move relative to the source to hold deep subthreshold, making a 1.2 V supply workable and improving tolerance to \u00b1100 mV sensor offsets without saturating.\n- Fast reset: Tying both halves hard to ground (or rail) during reset creates a strong, low-resistance path for rapid offset settling (<5 \u03bcs) without needing a large floating capacitor or aggressive clocks.\n- Low gate-cap leakage: Only a fraction of the gate area is left floating/bootstrapped, which proportionally reduces oxide and switch leakage into that node and limits charge injection at the reset/operate boundary, helping keep drift <1%/s over long recordings.\n- No extra rails or risky body bias: It needs no pumped body biases or higher auxiliary supplies, avoiding diode forward-bias and swing loss issues.\n\nIn contrast, A raises off-current and injection; B introduces periodic perturbations and added leakage paths through more switches; C is risky/impractical at 1.2 V (body-diode and rail constraints) and reduces swing; D loses the dynamic headroom relative to the source and thus sacrifices resistance range and offset tolerance.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",

Hence [SL2(Z):\u0393(2)] = 6 and [SL2(Z):H] is a multiple of 6.\n\n- Work modulo 4. In \u0393(2)/\u0393(4) (which is isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^3, generated by the images of U = [1 2; 0 1], V = [1 0; 2 1], and \u2212I), we compute:\n  a \u2261 [3 2; 2 3] \u2261 (\u2212I)\u00b7[1 2; 2 1] \u2261 (\u2212I)\u00b7(U V) (mod 4),\n  b \u2261 [1 0; 2 1] \u2261 V (mod 4).\n  Thus the image of H in \u0393(2)/\u0393(4) is the subgroup generated by V and (\u2212I)\u00b7U, which has order 4. Therefore H\u0393(4) has index 2 in \u0393(2), so [SL2(Z):H\u0393(4)] = [SL2(Z):\u0393(2)]\u00b7[\u0393(2):H\u0393(4)] = 6\u00b72 = 12. In particular, H \u2260 \u0393(2), so [SL2(Z):H] \u2265 12.\n\n- To see that equality holds, one checks that H contains \u0393(4): compute\n  c1 = (a^{-1}b)^2 = [281, \u22122892; 24, \u2212247] \u2261 U^2 (mod 8),\n  c2 = b^2 = [\u221239, 400; \u22124, 41] \u2261 V^{\u22122} (mod 8),\n  c3 = [a, b] = aba^{-1}b^{-1} = [85, \u2212712; 8, \u221267] \u2261 5\u00b7I (mod 8).\n  The images of c1, c2, c3 generate \u0393(4)/\u0393(8) \u2245 (Z/2Z)^3, hence H\u0393(8) = \u0393(4). Standard generation facts for \u0393(4) (and the explicit lifts above) then imply \u0393(4) \u2264 H. Consequently, since \u0393(4) \u2264 H \u2264 \u0393(2) and H\u0393(4) has index 2 in \u0393(2), we get [\u0393(2):H] = 2 and thus [SL2(Z):H] = 6\u00b72 = 12.\n\nAnswer: 12\n\nConfidence: 78%",

Knocking down Slc6a11 (GAT-3) in sucrose-preferring rats reproduces this higher PS amplitude (\u22120.37 mV), implying that reduced Slc6a11 lowers effective GABAergic tone (likely lowering ambient/extracellular GABA and tonic inhibition), thereby increasing excitability.

In H, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups equals the number of complements of C_m, which is |C_m| = m (the conjugates of the C_5-complement are parametrized by C_m, since the action is fixed-point-free). Now set G = C_3 \u00d7 H.

A worst-case construction is to take n/s disjoint cliques of size s; then each vertex in a clique has degree \u2248 s, so it is kept with probability \u2248 s^{-c}, and the probability that an entire clique survives is \u2248 s^{-cs}. With n/s independent cliques, the probability that at least one survives is about (n/s)\u00b7s^{-cs}. Setting this to be around 1/n gives the threshold s ln s \u2248 (2/c) ln n, hence s \u2248 (2/c) ln n / ln ln n. A surviving clique of size s has arboricity \u0398(s), so with probability > 1/n the arboricity is \u03a9(ln n / ln ln n). Thus any upper bound must be at least \u03c9(\u221alog n) but still o(log n). Conversely, a union bound over all size-s dense subsets shows that for s \u2265 K (ln n / ln ln n) (with K depending on c), the probability any such dense set survives is \u2264 1/n, yielding an upper bound O(ln n / ln ln n) w.h.p.

Its roots are \u03be1,2 = a \u00b1 d/\u221a2 with a = (\u03ba+1)/2 and d = (\u03ba\u22121)/2, hence the optimal steps are \u03b3i = 1/\u03bei. This yields\n\u03b31 = 2 / (\u03ba + 1 + (\u03ba \u2212 1)/\u221a2),  \u03b32 = 2 / (\u03ba + 1 \u2212 (\u03ba \u2212 1)/\u221a2)\n(up to swapping \u03b31 and \u03b32). The minimized worst-case contraction of the squared norm is [max_{\u03bb\u2208[1,\u03ba]} |p(\u03bb)|]^2 = [1/T2(a/d)]^2 = [(\u03ba \u2212 1)^2 / (\u03ba^2 + 6\u03ba + 1)]^2. For general \u03bc, multiply both \u03b31 and \u03b32 by 1/\u03bc.\n\nAnswer: \u03b31 = 2 / (\u03ba + 1 + (\u03ba \u2212 1)/\u221a2),  \u03b32 = 2 / (\u03ba + 1 \u2212 (\u03ba \u2212 1)/\u221a2) (order arbitrary). The optimal worst-case ratio is ((\u03ba \u2212 1)^2 / (\u03ba^2 + 6\u03ba + 1))^2.\n\nConfidence: 90%",

Two standard resource models are used:\n- Non-signaling resources (PR boxes).\n- Classical communication (plus shared randomness).\n\nKey facts:\n1) Dichotomic case (all 2-outcome measurements).\n- Sufficiency:\n  - 1 PR box per run is sufficient with shared randomness and no communication to reproduce the singlet correlations for all local projective measurements; the same construction extends to all 2-outcome POVMs by adding only local post-processing (Cerf\u2013Gisin\u2013Massar, PRL 94, 220403, 2005).\n  - Alternatively, 1 classical bit per run (with shared randomness) is sufficient to simulate all local projective measurements on a singlet (Toner\u2013Bacon, PRL 91, 187904, 2003); extending to 2-outcome POVMs again only requires local post-processing.\n- Lower bounds (average, from CHSH):\n  - If your set of POVMs contains settings attaining the Tsirelson value S = 2\u221a2, any exact simulation must use a nonlocal resource a nonzero fraction of the time. In the CHSH 2\u00d72\u00d72 scenario one has the convex decomposition bound: average PR-box use per run \u2265 (S \u2212 2)/(4 \u2212 2) = \u221a2 \u2212 1 \u2248 0.414. The same linear bound applies for any S in [2, 4]: average PR-box use \u2265 (S \u2212 2)/2.\n  - The same CHSH specialization gives an average classical-communication lower bound of at least \u221a2 \u2212 1 bits per run (since local strategies cap at S = 2 and one bit can reach S = 2\u221a2). Note: 1 bit per run is known to be sufficient in the universal (worst-case) sense; whether the exact universal average can be pushed strictly below 1 bit for all dichotomic POVMs remains unresolved\u2014no general exact protocol with <1 expected bit is known.\n\n2) Arbitrary finite-outcome POVMs on qubits.\n- Sufficiency carries over without increasing the nonlocal cost: the singlet\u2019s reduced states are maximally mixed, so local outcome biases are purely local and can be handled by shared randomness and local post-processing. The nonlocal part is a bilinear form in the Bloch vectors of the POVM effects, which can be simulated using exactly the same single binary nonlocal resource as in the projective case.\n- Thus, 1 PR box per run (with shared randomness, 0 communication) is sufficient to simulate all finite-outcome qubit POVMs on the singlet; alternatively, 1 classical bit per run is sufficient (with shared randomness).\n- Lower-bound remarks: If the set of POVMs contains a subset realizing a CHSH value S, the same average lower bound (S \u2212 2)/2 applies to the PR-box usage; similarly for average communication. Tighter general lower bounds for arbitrary POVMs beyond CHSH are not known to improve these figures.\n\nBottom line:\n- Universal exact simulation (all local POVMs on a singlet):\n  - PR-box model: 1 PR box per run suffices; average minimal use is at least \u221a2 \u2212 1 if the set attains Tsirelson (and more generally \u2265 (S \u2212 2)/2 for any achieved CHSH value S).\n  - Communication model: 1 classical bit per run suffices; the best universal average strictly below 1 bit is not known\u2014CHSH gives a necessary average of at least \u221a2 \u2212 1 bits whenever Tsirelson is attained.\n\nAnswer: - Sufficiency (universal, exact, with shared randomness):\n  - 1 PR box per run and 0 communication, or\n  - 0 PR boxes and 1 classical bit per run.\n- Average necessary nonlocal cost if the set attains CHSH value S:\n  - PR boxes: at least (S \u2212 2)/2 per run; for S = 2\u221a2 this is \u221a2 \u2212 1 \u2248 0.414.\n  - Classical communication: at least \u221a2 \u2212 1 bits per run for the CHSH-optimal subset; 1 bit per run is sufficient universally.\n\nConfidence: 58%",

For any group X of size |X| with common intersection size at least \u2113, both PJR and EJR impose claims when |X| \u2265 \u2113\u00b7n/k.\n\nHere the six given voters form a group X with |X|=6 and |\u2229_{i\u2208X} A(i)|=3 (namely {a,b,c}). To keep voter 1 unsatisfied, the committee must exclude a,b,c,x; the only candidates among the six voters\u2019 union that do not satisfy voter 1 are y and z.\n\n- PJR case:\n  - If n \u2264 200, then 6 \u2265 3\u00b7n/100, so the group is entitled to \u2113=3 seats from its union {a,b,c,x,y,z}. Providing 3 seats without using a,b,c,x is impossible because only y and z remain (two candidates). Hence impossible to leave voter 1 unsatisfied for n \u2264 200.\n  - If n = 201, the group is entitled to \u2113=2 (since 6 \u2265 2\u00b7201/100 = 4.02 but 6 < 3\u00b7201/100), which can be satisfied by placing y and z in the committee while excluding a,b,c,x, leaving voter 1 unsatisfied. The rest of the profile can be completed with voters having disjoint approvals so no further constraints arise. Thus s1 = 201.\n\n- EJR case:\n  - If n \u2264 300, then 6 \u2265 2\u00b7n/100, so the group is entitled to \u2113=2 under EJR. EJR would then require some member of the six to have at least two approved winners. Avoiding a,b,c,x leaves only {y,z}, but no voter among the six approves both y and z; thus impossible to keep voter 1 unsatisfied for n \u2264 300.\n  - If n = 301, the six-voter group is only entitled to \u2113=1 (since 6 \u2265 301/100 = 3.01 but 6 < 2\u00b7301/100 = 6.02). Take a committee that includes both y and z (and excludes a,b,c,x). Then every qualifying \u2113=1 cohesive subgroup of size at least 4 among the six contains either a y-approver (voters 2 or 3) or a z-approver (voters 4\u20136), so EJR is satisfied while voter 1 remains unsatisfied. Again, complete the profile with voters having disjoint approvals to avoid additional constraints. Thus s2 = 301.\n\nAnswer: (201, 301)\nConfidence: 90%",

For each of the k particles placed at 1 \u2264 x1 < x2 < \u2026 < xk, pre-sample an independent simple random walk path that will be used if/when that particle is activated. Let \u03c3i be the first-passage time to 0 of that walk if it had started at time 0 from xi. It is classical that for 1D simple symmetric random walk, P(\u03c3i > t) ~ ci/\u221at and E[\u03c3i] = \u221e, and that the \u03c3i\u2019s are independent across i.\n\n- Let Di be the activation time of particle i (D1 = 0). Once activated, particle i\u2019s time to hit 0 is distributed as an independent copy of \u03c3i, and it is independent of Di. Hence the actual hitting time to 0 for particle i is Ti = Di + \u03c3i\u2032 (\u03c3i\u2032 an independent copy of \u03c3i), and the time we care about is T = mini Ti.\n\n- First, a lower bound that forces divergence for k \u2264 2: If all k particles were started at time 0, the first hit of 0 would occur at \u03c4* = mini \u03c3i. Since delays Di \u2265 0 can only postpone hits, T \u2265 \u03c4* almost surely, hence E[T] \u2265 E[\u03c4*]. But P(\u03c4* > t) = \u220fi P(\u03c3i > t) ~ C t^{-k/2}, so E[\u03c4*] is infinite for k \u2264 2 (tail ~ t^{-1} when k = 2). Therefore E[T] = \u221e for k = 1 and k = 2, irrespective of positions.\n\n- Now an upper bound that yields finiteness for k \u2265 3: It suffices to use the first three particles. Their activation times D2, D3 are hitting times of fixed sites by a (union of) simple random walks, so P(Dj > t) \u2264 C/\u221at (a standard 1D first-passage tail). Decompose according to whether D2 and D3 are \u2264 t/2:\n  \u2022 If D2 \u2264 t/2 and D3 \u2264 t/2, then by time t/2 there are three independent active walks; for T > t we need all three to avoid 0 for at least t/2 more steps. That probability is at most C/t^{3/2}.\n  \u2022 If exactly one of D2, D3 exceeds t/2, the event has probability O(t^{-1/2}). Conditional on that, T > t requires two independent walks to avoid 0 for \u2265 t/2, which contributes O(1/t). Product gives O(t^{-3/2}).\n  \u2022 If both D2 and D3 exceed t/2, the event has probability O(1/t). Conditional on that, T > t requires the first walk to avoid 0 for t, which is O(1/\u221at). Again O(t^{-3/2}).\n  Summing these contributions yields P(T > t) \u2264 C\u2032 t^{-3/2} for large t, which is summable. Hence E[T] < \u221e for k \u2265 3.\n\n- This argument does not depend on the particular locations xi (aside from constants), only on having at least three particles.\n\nAnswer: 3\n\nConfidence: 83%",

Thus cos \u03b1 = l/d = (10\u221a3)/20 = \u221a3/2 \u21d2 \u03b1 = 30\u00b0. Hence the circle\u2019s center is at height z_c = R sin \u03b1 = 10 \u00d7 1/2 = 5 m; the bottom point is on the ground and the top is at 10 m.\n- Let \u03c6 be the angular position along the circle measured from the \u201crightmost\u201d side point so that the highest point is at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2. The given \u201creaches the highest point during the first quarter\u201d and CCW motion select the start P as this rightmost side point (\u03c60 = 0), since from there the top is reached after a quarter turn.\n- The height of the contact point on the path is z_path(\u03c6) = z_c + R sin \u03b1 sin \u03c6 = 5 + 5 sin \u03c6.\n- The robot\u2019s leg is normal to the plane; its vertical component is cos \u03b1, so the joint for the arm is higher by h cos \u03b1 = 1 \u00d7 \u221a3/2 = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866 m.\n- The arm (length r = 0.25 m) rotates about the radial axis. Define \u03b2 from the leg (normal) toward the forward tangent; then the arm unit vector is u_arm = cos \u03b2 N + sin \u03b2 u_t.

The isolated product shows three aromatic signals >6 ppm, which is exactly what you\u2019d expect for a monobrominated species: one thiophene ring is brominated (only its 3-H remains), while the other ring is unbrominated (retaining both 3-H and 5-H). Thus, the new TLC spot is the mono-brominated intermediate, most likely brominated at the 5-position of one flanking thiophene.

Because these scores and the test residual are not exchangeable, the usual conformal validity argument does not apply. In fact, there is no nontrivial distribution\u2011free lower bound on the marginal coverage for this \u201cjackknife\u201d interval: one can construct an algorithm/distribution pair for which the LOO residuals are small (hence the quantile is small) while the full\u2011fit prediction at the test point is arbitrarily biased, making the interval miss with arbitrarily high probability.\n\nConcrete construction: let X be constant and Y i.i.d. N(0,1). Define A_m to predict mean(Y) + b_m, with b_{n\u22121}=0 but b_n=M for some large M. Then the LOO residuals {|Y_i \u2212 mean_{j\u2260i} Y_j|} (and their quantile) are unaffected by M and stay finite, while the test interval is centered at mean(Y_all)+M.

            "response": "Explanation: \n- Initial trauma management and decision about replantation\n  - 28 hours extra-oral time means the periodontal ligament (PDL) cells on the avulsed teeth are non-viable. In an adult with HbA1c 7.5% who is not on diabetes treatment, the risks of infection, delayed healing, ankylosis and replacement resorption are high.\n  - According to IADT guidelines, teeth with >60 minutes dry time can be replanted primarily to preserve alveolar bone, but the prognosis is poor. In this patient, given poor glycemic control and multiple adjacent teeth missing, the safer choice is not to replant now. Instead:\n    - Assess ABCs and facial/head injuries (already done), take periapical/occlusal radiographs/CBCT if available to rule out root fragments and alveolar fractures.\n    - Irrigate sockets with saline, gently debride coagulum, reposition any alveolar fragments, and suture soft tissues.\n    - Medications: start systemic antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate; if penicillin-allergic, doxycycline if not pregnant; or clindamycin), 0.12% chlorhexidine rinse twice daily for 1\u20132 weeks, analgesics. Update tetanus.\n    - Very important: urgent referral to a physician to initiate diabetes therapy and improve glycemic control before any definitive surgical/prosthetic steps.\n    - Provide an immediate, pressure-relieved interim acrylic partial denture (\u201cflipper\u201d) as a surgical stent and for esthetics, adjusted to avoid loading the sockets. Soft diet and meticulous oral hygiene.\n  - If replantation is still elected after informed consent (for ridge preservation despite poor prognosis): treat as >60 min dry time, closed apices:\n    - Handle by the crown, gently remove necrotic PDL from the root surfaces, soak roots in 2% sodium fluoride for 20 minutes, perform extra-oral root canal obturation (or within 7\u201310 days post-replantation), irrigate sockets, replant with gentle pressure, verify with radiographs, place a flexible splint for 2 weeks, suture soft tissues, antibiotics/CHX as above, and close follow-up for ankylosis and replacement resorption. In this diabetic patient, this option remains relatively contraindicated until glycemic control is improved.\n\n- Meaning of SNB 88\u00b0 and its impact\n  - SNB 88\u00b0 indicates a skeletal Class III (mandibular prognathism). Expect anterior crossbite/edge-to-edge relationships. For prosthodontics, plan for crossbite setup of the maxillary prosthetic lateral/canine region and group function rather than canine guidance (since the canine is missing).\n\n- \u201cWhich cells are of interest?\u201d\n  - The viability of periodontal ligament cells\u2014particularly PDL fibroblasts and cementoblasts\u2014is the critical determinant for successful replantation. After ~28 hours dry, these cells are non-viable, which is why ankylosis/replacement resorption is expected if replantation is attempted. (If discussing resorption, odontoclasts/osteoclasts mediate the replacement resorption.)\n\n- Definitive tooth replacement choice, denture type, material, abutments, and reasons\n  - Given three adjacent teeth missing (lateral incisor, canine, first premolar) in a bounded unilateral space, and uncontrolled diabetes (implants deferred; long-span fixed bridge unfavorable), choose a removable partial denture.\n  - Classification: Kennedy Class III (single unilateral bounded edentulous area).\n  - Immediate phase: an interim acrylic RPD (auto/heat-cured PMMA) to protect healing tissues and restore esthetics.\n  - Definitive phase (after soft-tissue and occlusal stabilization, and improved glycemic control): a cast cobalt\u2013chromium (Co\u2013Cr) framework RPD with acrylic resin teeth/gingival flanges.\n    - Major connector: maxilla\u2014single broad palatal strap (rigid, thin, hygienic). Mandible\u2014lingual bar if adequate floor of mouth; otherwise lingual plate.\n    - Abutment teeth on the involved side:\n      - Mesial abutment: the central incisor\u2014use a cingulum rest seat for support (hidden, esthetic). Avoid visible labial clasps.\n      - Distal abutments: the second premolar as the primary abutment with a mesial occlusal rest, proximal plate, and a cast circumferential (Akers) clasp engaging a suitable buccal undercut. Add an embrasure rest/clasp on the first molar with the second premolar to distribute load and provide reciprocation/bracing.\n    - Contralateral retention: add a posterior clasp (e.g., on the opposite premolar/molar) for cross-arch balance and rigidity, keeping anterior esthetics uncompromised.\n    - Tooth setup: arrange maxillary prosthetic lateral/canine in crossbite or edge-to-edge as required by the skeletal Class III; occlusion in group function, avoiding heavy anterior guidance on the prosthetic teeth.\n  - Reasons for these choices:\n    - RPD over bridge/implants: long-span fixed FPD from a central incisor to a second premolar is biomechanically unfavorable (especially in Class III with lateral forces) and esthetically challenging; implants are postponed until diabetes is well-controlled. An RPD distributes forces to multiple teeth and can be adjusted as healing progresses.\n    - Co\u2013Cr framework: rigid, thin, durable, and easier to keep clean than flexible nylon\u2014important for a diabetic patient at higher risk of infection and candidiasis. Rests provide tooth support, preventing tissue-borne loading and ridge resorption.\n    - Abutment selection: the second premolar and first molar provide strong posterior support and retention; a cingulum rest on the central incisor provides anterior support while preserving esthetics. Cross-arch stabilization enhances function and longevity.\n\nAnswer: \n- Do not replant the teeth at 28 hours in an untreated diabetic; manage the sockets surgically, give antibiotics/CHX/tetanus, provide an interim acrylic partial, and urgently optimize glycemic control. If replantation is still chosen for ridge preservation, treat as >60 min dry time: remove necrotic PDL, NaF soak, extra-oral RCT, gentle replantation, flexible splint 2 weeks, antibiotics/CHX, and close follow-up.\n- SNB 88\u00b0 indicates skeletal Class III; plan crossbite/anterior group function in prosthetic setup.\n- Cells of interest: periodontal ligament cells (PDL fibroblasts and cementoblasts; resorption mediated by clastic cells if replantation is attempted).\n- Denture plan: Immediate PMMA interim partial followed by a definitive maxillary Co\u2013Cr cast RPD with acrylic teeth. Abutments: central incisor (cingulum rest) and second premolar (primary abutment with rest/proximal plate/Akers clasp), sharing support with the first molar and contralateral posterior abutment for cross-arch retention. Rationale: tooth-supported, hygienic, rigid, esthetic, and biomechanically favorable given the long bounded span and Class III occlusion; implants deferred until diabetes is controlled and a fixed long-span bridge is biomechanically unfavorable.\n\nConfidence: 78%",

For the unit sphere this is equivalent to p\u00b7(x \u2212 p) \u2265 0, i.e., p\u00b7x \u2265 1. Thus each guard sees exactly the exterior points lying in the closed half-space beyond the tangent plane at p (p\u00b7x = 1).\n\n- No finite set suffices: For any finite set of guards {p_i}, there exists a direction u on S^2 at a positive angular distance \u03b4 from all p_i. For points x = r u with 1 < r < 1/ cos \u03b4, we have p_i\u00b7x = r(p_i\u00b7u) \u2264 r cos \u03b4 < 1 for all i, so x is unseen.

To avoid eventual constancy modulo 10^10, we cannot have both 2 and 5 dividing n (that would force n^k \u2261 0 mod 10^10 eventually), and we must avoid being \u22611 mod the 10th power on the unit side.\n- Minimizing n: take v5(n) \u2265 1 and n \u2261 1 mod 2^9 but not \u2261 1 mod 2^10. Solve n \u2261 1 (mod 512) and n \u2261 0 (mod 5). The solutions are n \u2261 1025 (mod 2560). The smallest is 1025, but it is \u2261 1 mod 1024, which would make the powers eventually constant mod 10^10 (contrary to property 2). The next is n = 3585, which is \u2261 1 mod 512 but \u2261 513 mod 1024.\n- Check property 1: Since v5(3585)=1, for k \u2265 9 we have 3585^k \u2261 0 (mod 5^9). And 3585 \u2261 1 (mod 512) gives 3585^k \u2261 1 (mod 2^9). By CRT, 3585^k is constant modulo 10^9 for all k \u2265 9 (indeed the constant is 212,890,625).\n- Check property 2: For k \u2265 10, 3585^k \u2261 0 (mod 5^10). Modulo 2^10, 3585 \u2261 513 = 1 + 512, so (1+512)^k \u2261 1 + k\u00b7512 (mod 1024), giving 1 for even k and 513 for odd k. Thus the last 10 digits alternate (between 8212890625 and 3212890625), so they are not eventually constant.\n- Any alternative construction leads to a larger minimal n: n even with n \u2261 1 (mod 5^9) gives n \u2265 5^9+1 = 1,953,126; n \u2261 1 (mod 10^9) gives n \u2265 1,000,000,001.\n\nAnswer: 3585\n\nConfidence: 96%",

Hence we can write\n\u03c3_t^2 = \u03c3_{t\u22121}^2 Y_t, where Y_t iid\u223c (1/\u03bd)\u03c7^2_\u03bd.\nThus \u03c3_t^2 = \u220f_{k=1}^t Y_k and S_t = 1 + \u2211_{i=1}^t \u220f_{k=1}^i Y_k.\n\n- Almost sure behavior: By Jensen\u2019s inequality,\nE[ln Y_1] = E[ln \u03c7^2_\u03bd] \u2212 ln \u03bd < ln E[\u03c7^2_\u03bd] \u2212 ln \u03bd = ln \u03bd \u2212 ln \u03bd = 0.\nBy the SLLN, (1/t) ln \u03c3_t^2 \u2192 E[ln Y_1] < 0 a.s., so \u03c3_t^2 \u2192 0 exponentially fast a.s. Consequently,\nlimsup_i (\u03c3_i^2)^{1/i} = exp(E[ln Y_1]) < 1 a.s.,\nand the root test implies the series \u2211_{i=0}^\u221e \u03c3_i^2 converges a.s.

In fact S_\u221e satisfies the perpetuity equation S_\u221e d= 1 + Y S_\u221e with Y \u223c (1/\u03bd)\u03c7^2_\u03bd independent of S_\u221e.\n\n- L1 convergence: Note E[Y_t] = 1 (since E[\u03c7^2_\u03bd] = \u03bd), so E[\u03c3_t^2] = 1 for all t (\u03c3_t^2 is a nonnegative martingale). Hence E[S_t] = \u2211_{i=0}^t E[\u03c3_i^2] = t+1 \u2192 \u221e. If S_t converged in L1 to some integrable S, we would have E[S_t] \u2192 E[S] < \u221e, a contradiction.

If you can tell me which human \u03b21 isoform (UniProt/RefSeq ID) you mean, I can give you the exact \u03b21 residue numbers. Below I summarize the universally conserved hotspots and how they map conceptually; then I note what is (and isn\u2019t) known about residues that fine\u2011tune gating.\n\n1) Hotspots in \u03b21 that mediate binding to \u03b11 (AID-binding pocket)\n- What is known with high confidence: The \u03b2 subunit binds the \u03b11 I\u2013II linker\u2019s \u03b1-interaction domain (AID) in a conserved \u201calpha-binding pocket\u201d (ABP) located on the guanylate-kinase (GK) domain of Cav\u03b2. Structural and mutational studies identify a small set of residues as true hotspots for binding across \u03b2 isoforms. In Cav\u03b22a numbering (used in the 2004 crystal structures), the canonical hotspot triad is:\n  - Trp391 (W391)\n  - Tyr396 (Y396)\n  - Tyr437 (Y437)\n  Mutating any of these (to Ala) severely weakens or abolishes \u03b11 binding. Additional conserved hydrophobic residues that line the ABP and contribute significantly to affinity include (\u03b22a numbering): Val339, Ile343, Phe371/Leu371 (depending on isoform), Met294\u2013Met298 region, and Leu/Met around 395\u2013399. These form the hydrophobic groove that captures the AID\u2019s conserved \u03a6XX\u03a6\u03a6 motif.\n- How this applies to human \u03b21: The side chains at those positions are conserved in CACNB1, and there is a one\u2011to\u2011one structural equivalence in the \u03b21 GK domain. However, the absolute residue numbers differ by isoform because \u03b21 splice variants have different N\u2011terminal lengths. Once you specify \u03b21a vs \u03b21b (or give a sequence ID), I will map the \u03b22a hotspots (W391, Y396, Y437, plus the flanking hydrophobics) to the exact CACNB1 residue numbers and give you the precise list for human \u03b21.\n\n2) Hotspots in \u03b21 that fine\u2011tune (modulate) \u03b11 gating\n- What is known with high confidence: Fine\u2011tuning of gating by \u03b2 subunits arises from more than just the AID\u2013ABP contact. Several \u03b2 regions contribute:\n  - The same ABP residues above (e.g., W/Y/Y triad) indirectly affect gating by controlling binding geometry/affinity to the \u03b11 IS6\u2013AID helix pair.\n  - The HOOK (the flexible linker between SH3 and GK) and parts of the SH3 domain (RT loop and n\u2011Src loop) modulate activation/inactivation kinetics when mutated.\n  - \u03b2 N\u2011terminus and C\u2011terminus can also tune inactivation and voltage dependence; for \u03b22a, palmitoylated Cys3/Cys4 slow inactivation, but \u03b21 lacks these cysteines, so \u03b21 relies more on HOOK/SH3/GK surfaces.\n- What is not as crisp: There is no universally accepted, minimal set of \u201cgating-only\u201d hotspot residues on \u03b21 that are independent of binding. Many reported gating effects come from mutations in:\n  - GK-surface residues adjacent to the ABP that contact the \u03b11 IS6\u2013AID helix (conserved hydrophobics near the W/Y/Y triad).\n  - HOOK prolines/acidics and SH3 loop residues (mutations here shift V1/2 and alter inactivation time constants).\n  - \u03b21-specific splice insertions/deletions that alter HOOK length/composition.\nBecause most of these determinants are conserved and context-dependent, authors usually report effects in \u03b22a/\u03b23/\u03b24, then map to \u03b21 by alignment. For human \u03b21, the exact residue numbers again depend on the isoform.\n\nIf you provide:\n- the exact human \u03b21 isoform (e.g., CACNB1-1/\u03b21a vs CACNB1-2/\u03b21b; UniProt accession and isoform number), and\n- optionally the \u03b11 sequence segment (Cav2.3/CACNA1E AID) you are using,\nI will return:\n- Part 1: the precise CACNB1 residue numbers (and side chains) that form the ABP hotspot (the W/Y/Y core plus the significant hydrophobic contacts).\n- Part 2: the best-supported CACNB1 residues implicated in gating modulation (HOOK and SH3-loop positions and the GK-surface residues adjacent to the ABP), with exact human \u03b21 numbering and citations.\n\nAnswer: Please specify which human \u03b21 isoform (e.g., \u03b21a vs \u03b21b; UniProt/RefSeq ID). The conserved binding hotspots on \u03b2 subunits are the ABP residues in the GK domain\u2014classically W391, Y396, and Y437 in \u03b22a numbering, plus adjacent hydrophobics (e.g., V339, I343, M/L around 294\u2013299 and 395\u2013399). These map 1:1 onto human \u03b21 but with different residue numbers depending on the isoform. Gating modulation hotspots involve the same ABP-adjacent GK surface plus residues in the HOOK and SH3 loops; I can list the exact CACNB1 positions once the isoform is specified.\n\nConfidence: 45%",

The other options incorrectly conflate RA binding with DNA binding (C, D), offer unlikely uniform effects (E), or omit activation implications (B).\n\nAnswer: A\n\nConfidence: 65%",

This is classically due to uniparental disomy. Deletions and duplications change copy number, and trisomy increases dosage. Although mitotic recombination can also produce segmental cnLOH, uniparental disomy is the prototypical mechanism that maintains gene dosage despite loss of one parental allele.\nAnswer: D.

This preserves both copies and allows divergence without requiring a rare new advantageous function.

Since tan is \u03c0-periodic, this reduces to finding tan(r), where r = 10^100 \u2212 n\u03c0 for an integer n. To determine tan(r) to three decimal places, r must be known to within roughly 5\u00d710^-4 radians (or better), because small errors in r propagate through tan via sec^2(r). This, in turn, requires knowing \u03c0 to about 103 decimal digits (or more in the worst case), so that n = round(10^100/\u03c0) and the residual r are accurate enough. Without performing extremely high-precision arithmetic (effectively computing \u03c0 and 10^100/\u03c0 to over 100 digits and then evaluating tan at that precision), the requested three digits cannot be reliably determined. Therefore, absent high-precision computation tools, this cannot be answered definitively.\nAnswer: Not determinable here without >100-digit precision modular reduction by \u03c0\nConfidence: 95%",

Hence exactly 128 rules (half of 256) are compact (those with b0=f(000)=0).\n- A glider over the zero background must move its finite support by exactly one cell per step (edge speed bound is 1 per step, so to achieve any nonzero net shift in T steps, each step must shift the left and right edges by 1). Thus, the existence of a glider is determined entirely by what happens at the two edges.\n- Right-moving gliders occur in two edge-structure regimes:\n  1) Isolated edge (neighbor inside is 0): to erase the leftmost cell and create the new rightmost cell, we need b1=f(001)=0, b2=f(010)=0 (to prevent lingering center), and b4=f(100)=1. This gives 2^4=16 rules (free bits b3,b5,b6,b7).\n  2) Contiguous edge (neighbor inside is 1): to erase the leftmost endpoint and extend on the right, we need b3=f(011)=0 and b6=f(110)=1, along with b1=0 and b4=1 to ensure no spurious creation just outside. This gives 2^3=8 rules (free bits b2,b5,b7).\n  Their intersection (rules supporting both types) has b1=0, b2=0, b3=0, b4=1, b6=1, giving 2^2=4 rules. Hence right-moving gliders exist in 16+8\u22124=20 compact rules.\n- By left-right symmetry, left-moving gliders are obtained by swapping left/right bits: b1\u2194b4 and b3\u2194b6, yielding another 20 rules. These are disjoint from the right-moving set (they require b1=1, b4=0 vs b1=0, b4=1).\n- No additional period>1 cases arise: since the edge speed per step is at most 1, any nonzero net displacement in T steps forces each edge to advance by 1 at every step; the edge-neighborhood cases are exactly those covered above. More complex shapes (e.g., with gaps) reduce to the isolated-edge conditions (subset of the single-1 case), and larger contiguous blocks reduce to the contiguous-edge conditions (subset of the block case).\n\nTherefore, the number of compact ECAs that have a glider is 20 (right) + 20 (left) = 40.\n\nAnswer: 40\n\nConfidence: 80%",

That short-horizon continuation (price impact) makes the midprice 15 seconds later more likely to be above the buyer\u2019s trade price and below the seller\u2019s trade price, so the 15s return is higher for buys than sells. This effect is widely documented across markets (including SZSE, SSE, Nasdaq, HKEX). It\u2019s not an artifact of the 15s-return definition\u2014if anything, the definition would bias buyer returns downward absent drift (you buy near the ask but evaluate vs mid later).

If that 64 cm\u00b3 were filled with T1 cubes, it would yield 64 / 0.512 = 125 T1 cubes (value 125). Replacing that region with one B2 yields 150, i.e., a net gain of 25 over T1. At most four 4\u00d74\u00d74 regions fit in the billet (2\u00d72\u00d71), so the maximum possible gain over all-T1 is 4\u00d725 = 100. Hence the global maximum value is 500 + 100 = 600, achieved by making 4 B2 balls. Mixing in B1 (1 cm diameter) is inferior: it yields 1 per 1\u00d71\u00d71 cube, worse than T1 (which yields ~1.953 per cm\u00b3), so it never improves the total.\n\nTherefore, the best valid option is 4 B2 balls for a total of 600.

Every conjugacy class has a geodesic representative of minimal length in its class; such a word is cyclically geodesic: all of its cyclic permutations are also geodesic (and thus (1,0)-quasigeodesic). Therefore one can take \u03b5 = 0, independent of \u03b4 and R.\n- C: No. Context-freeness of K does not force its conjugacy closure to consist only of quasigeodesic words (in any uniform sense); by inserting long conjugators around elements of K in a non-free hyperbolic group, one can obtain representatives whose cyclic permutations fail to be quasigeodesic with any fixed constants.\n\nAnswer: \nA.

For any nontrivial smooth (even Schwartz) initial data whose Fourier transform does not have Gaussian-type decay, the factor e^{c(t)|\u03be|^2} makes the L^2 norm (and Sobolev norms) infinite for any t > 0. Hence the problem is ill-posed forward in time and solutions blow up instantaneously for generic smooth data. The nonlinear transport and pressure terms are energy-conservative (in L^2) and cannot compensate this anti-diffusion; in fact the energy identity reads\nd/dt (1/2)\u2016u(t)\u2016_2^2 = (1+t)\u2016\u2207u(t)\u2016_2^2 \u2265 0,\nconfirming anti-dissipative growth.

The first nontrivial placement 2 must be between two 1\u2019s. After that, 3 would require an empty site whose two neighbors are {1,2}; but the only positions that have 2 as a neighbor are exactly those occupied by the two 1\u2019s used to create the 2, so 3 is impossible. Thus for any n\u22652, a(n)=2 in 1D; in particular a(2)=2, a(3)=2, a(42)=2.\n- For higher dimensions, a conservative stance is that unbounded growth is unlikely to be forced merely by increasing n, and linear bounds in n are plausible. The specific lower bounds in 3D and 4D of the form (2^d+1)(n\u22121)+1 are compatible with constructive local patterns, while for 5D an upper bound strictly below 33(n\u22121)+1 for large n can hold without contradicting those lower-dimensional statements.

For two uses,\n  - B = [[0, 0], [b, 0]] so X1 = V1, X2 = V2 + b Z1.\n  - The power constraint is tr(K_X) = tr(S + B K_Z B^T) = s11 + (s22 + b^2) = P1 + P2 \u2264 2P, with s11 = P1 and s22 = P2 \u2212 b^2 \u2265 0, hence |b| \u2264 \u221aP2.\n- The output covariance is K_Y = S + (I + B) K_Z (I + B)^T. Because det(I + B) = 1 (unit lower-triangular), the mutual information simplifies to\n  I = (1/2) log( |K_Y| / |K_Z| ).\n- With S chosen diagonal (s12 = 0), a straightforward computation gives\n  |K_Y| = (1 + P1)(1 + P2) \u2212 \u03b1^2 \u2212 b^2 + 2 \u03b1 P1 b.\n  This is a concave quadratic in b.

In the given set, 4 = 2^2 and 9 = 3^2, so t = 4 and t = 9 do not satisfy the statement.\n- For the remaining t (2, 3, 5, 7, 15), one can use a symmetry pairing argument to show that for every n, the number of t-omino tilings of the n\u00d7n square is even. Specifically, pair each tiling with its 180\u00b0 rotation; non-centrally-symmetric tilings are paired, contributing an even count. It remains to consider 180\u00b0-symmetric tilings (fixed points of that rotation). Reflecting such a tiling across the main diagonal gives an involution on the set of 180\u00b0-symmetric tilings; the only way a tiling could be fixed by both 180\u00b0 rotation and diagonal reflection is if it were 90\u00b0-rotationally symmetric. But a 90\u00b0-symmetric tiling would force the existence of a single tile occupying the entire board when t is a perfect square; since here t is not a perfect square, such doubly symmetric tilings do not occur. Hence the 180\u00b0-symmetric tilings are themselves paired, so their number is even, and thus the total number of tilings is even.\n\nTherefore the statement holds exactly for t that are not perfect squares in the given list.\n\nAnswer: {2, 3, 5, 7, 15}\n\nConfidence: 58%",

Among Group IV metals, zirconium provides the best balance of reactivity and stability for these transformations (Ti is generally less effective for hydrogenolysis of inert C\u2013C bonds; Hf is more robust but typically slower).\n\nKey to enabling both functions is placing an alkyl-only Zr center into a highly electrophilic, weakly coordinated environment that can become a Zr\u2013H under H2 yet behaves as a cationic Zr\u2013alkyl in the presence of olefin. This is most reliably achieved by grafting a tetraneopentyl zirconium precursor onto a strongly Br\u00f8nsted-acidic oxide that furnishes a weakly coordinating counter-anion and isolates single sites. Sulfated alumina (Al2O3\u2013SO3H, often denoted AIS) or perfluorosulfonated silica/alumina are ideal: they generate cationic AIS\u2013O\u2013Zr\u2013R species that, upon mild H2 treatment, form AIS\u2013O\u2013Zr\u2013H. These sites are proven to hydrogenolyze polyethylene/polypropylene to C1\u2013C20 alkanes at comparatively low temperatures (\u2248120\u2013200\u00b0C, 1\u201310 bar H2) via insertion/\u03b2-alkyl transfer and \u03c3-bond metathesis pathways without needing noble metals, and the same cationic Zr\u2013alkyl sites polymerize ethylene/propylene efficiently in the absence of H2 (the support anion behaves like an immobilized weakly coordinating anion, akin to supported borates used industrially for metallocenes).\n\nPractical implementation:\n- Metal: Zr (primary choice); Hf as a more thermally robust but typically less reactive alternative.\n- Ligand set: Neopentyl alkyls (e.g., Zr(CH2tBu)4) to avoid \u03b2-H elimination during site formation and to cleanly generate Zr\u2013H under H2. No strongly donating spectator ligands (e.g., biphenyls, phosphines) that would suppress electrophilicity.\n- Support: Strong Br\u00f8nsted-acidic, weakly coordinating oxide\u2014sulfated alumina (AIS) preferred; perfluorosulfonated silica/alumina is also suitable. Grafting onto isolated surface OH groups yields well-defined single sites; acidity stabilizes the cation.\n- Operating modes: \n  \u2022 Hydrogenolysis: preform Zr\u2013H with H2 and run at 120\u2013200\u00b0C, 1\u201310 bar H2 to obtain short saturated alkanes. \n  \u2022 Polymerization: purge H2, feed olefin; the cationic Zr\u2013alkyl sites propagate rapidly (single-site polymerization). \n- Optional refinement for stereocontrol in polymerization: a constrained-geometry amido\u2013cyclopentadienyl Zr/Hf complex immobilized on an acidic oxide can improve polymerization control, but it typically sacrifices hydrogenolysis rate relative to the alkyl-only Zr hydride on AIS.\n\nIn short, cationic zirconium neopentyl/hydride single sites generated by grafting Zr(CH2tBu)4 onto sulfated alumina (forming AIS\u2013O\u2013Zr\u2013H/alkyl)+ are the optimal, literature-validated combination for fast polyolefin hydrogenolysis to short alkanes and high-activity single-site olefin polymerization within one catalyst platform.\n\nAnswer: Zirconium neopentyl single sites on a strongly Br\u00f8nsted-acidic, weakly coordinating oxide\u2014specifically Zr(CH2tBu)4 grafted onto sulfated alumina (AIS) to form cationic AIS\u2013O\u2013Zr\u2013H/alkyl species. This Zr/AIS catalyst efficiently hydrogenolyzes polyolefins to short alkanes under H2 and, without H2, serves as a highly active single-site olefin polymerization catalyst. (Hf is a viable, more robust alternative; perfluorosulfonated silica/alumina can substitute for AIS.)\n\nConfidence: 78%",

Take the tetrahedron with vertices (1,1,1), (\u22121,\u22121,1), (\u22121,1,\u22121), (1,\u22121,\u22121).

These three planes are in general position (pairwise non-parallel, intersecting in a point).\n\n- For any n > 4, you can add vertices without changing those three projections from being quadrilaterals. Keep the same three planes (xy, xz, yz). Any point with |x|<1, |y|<1, |z|<1 projects strictly inside each of those squares. Hence, if you add points in the open cube (\u22121,1)^3 but outside the original tetrahedron, their projections lie strictly inside each square, so the projected convex hull on each of the three planes remains exactly that square (a quadrilateral). By choosing these added points in general position on the boundary of the new 3D convex hull (so that each is exposed by some supporting plane), they are genuine new vertices of the polyhedron. You can add as many such points as you like, obtaining convex polyhedra with any prescribed number of vertices n \u2265 4, while keeping those three projections quadrilateral.\n\n- Obviously, n < 4 is impossible for a 3D convex polyhedron.\n\nTherefore, every integer n \u2265 4 is achievable.\n\nAnswer: All integers n \u2265 4\n\nConfidence: 80%",

Finally, if V(p) is simple, then as the adjoint (vacuum) module over L_k(sl_2) it is irreducible.\nAnswer: (a) Yes; (b) both; (c) Yes\nConfidence: 78%",

If E1,\u2026,Em are mutually independent and nontrivial, then for every choice of taking Ei or its complement, the probability of the intersection is a product of factors qi\u2208{P(Ei),1\u2212P(Ei)}. Each such product must be a multiple of 1/N, so its denominator (in lowest terms) can only contain powers of 2 and 3, with total 2-adic exponent \u2264100 and total 3-adic exponent \u2264100.\n\nFor each i, let s2(i)=max{2-adic denominator exponent of P(Ei), of 1\u2212P(Ei)} and similarly s3(i) for 3-adic. Then for all intersections we must have \u03a3i s2(i) \u2264 100 and \u03a3i s3(i) \u2264 100. Any nontrivial Ei satisfies s2(i)\u22651 or s3(i)\u22651 (otherwise both P(Ei) and 1\u2212P(Ei) would be integers, forcing P(Ei)=0 or 1). Hence\nm \u2264 \u03a3i [1] \u2264 \u03a3i s2(i) + \u03a3i s3(i) \u2264 100 + 100 = 200.\nSo m \u2264 200.\n\nThis bound is tight. Construct 200 mutually independent events as follows: for each of the 100 dice, let Ai be \u201cthe i-th die is even\u201d (probability 1/2) and Bi be \u201cthe i-th die is divisible by 3\u201d (probability 1/3). For a single die, P(Ai\u2229Bi)=1/6=(1/2)(1/3), so Ai and Bi are independent; across different dice, all such events are independent because the dice are independent. Thus the 200 events {A1,\u2026,A100,B1,\u2026,B100} are mutually independent.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible m is 200. (If one were to allow the trivial events \u2205 and \u03a9, they are independent of everything and could add at most 2 more distinct events, but standard interpretations exclude trivial events in such maxima.)\n\nAnswer: 200\nConfidence: 87%",

A candle of length 2k cm occupies k consecutive unit cells in its orientation. For the large package, there are 9 red horizontal bars and 9 green vertical bars with lengths 1,2,...,9 (in cells), so the total area is (1+...+9) + (1+...+9) = 90 unit cells. Hence the tray must be 10 by 9 (or 9 by 10). To have exactly one vertical green segment per column and one horizontal red segment per row, the red-occupied cells in each row and in each column must be contiguous. With all lengths 1,2,...,9 occurring exactly once in each orientation, the only possible tiling shape is the staircase boundary that gives row red lengths 9,8,...,1,0 (over 10 rows) and column green lengths 1,2,...,9 (over 9 columns). Up to the four corner orientations of this staircase (reflections/rotations counted as distinct), this configuration is unique. Thus:\n- Large package: 4 arrangements.\n\nFor the small package, both red and green are horizontal. The total area is (1+...+8) + (1+...+8) = 72, so the tray must be 8 by 9.

Since G has a perfect matching, any maximum matching has size 1000, so we may take M to be perfect.\n\nContract each edge of M to a super-vertex. Each original vertex has degree 3, with one edge in M and two outside M, so each super-vertex in the contracted multigraph H has degree 4. The adjustability condition implies that for any two matched edges (u,v) and (u',v'), edges between v and v' occur if and only if the corresponding edges between u and u' occur. Hence between any two super-vertices in H, edges occur in parallel pairs (0 or 2 parallel edges, but not 1 or 4). Therefore, if we \u201cdivide\u201d multiplicities by 2, we get a simple 2-regular graph Q on the 1000 super-vertices; Q is thus a disjoint union of cycles. G is connected iff Q is connected, so Q must be a single 1000-cycle.\n\nReconstructing G from Q: each super-vertex is a matched pair (a \u201crung\u201d), and each adjacency in Q corresponds to two edges between neighboring rungs, which can be either \u201cstraight\u201d (a-to-a and b-to-b) or \u201ccrossed\u201d (a-to-b and b-to-a). Up to isomorphism, only the parity of the number of crossings around the cycle matters (local swaps of the labels within a rung flip the status of the two incident adjacencies). Hence there are exactly two non-isomorphic possibilities:\n- Even parity: the circular ladder (prism) C1000 \u25a1 K2.\n- Odd parity: the M\u00f6bius ladder on 2000 vertices.\n\nBoth are connected 3-regular graphs with a perfect matching M that is adjustable. They are non-isomorphic (e.g., for n = 1000 even, the prism is bipartite, the M\u00f6bius ladder is not). Therefore, there are exactly two non-isomorphic graphs.\n\nAnswer: 2\nConfidence: 86%",

The four faces are the planes 75 z \u00b1 110 x = 8250 and 75 z \u00b1 110 y = 8250; base plane is z = 0. A scan is a sphere of radius r (10\u201350 m) that must lie entirely inside (distance from center to each bounding plane \u2265 r), with centers on a 0.5 m grid, and scans must be pairwise disjoint.\n\n1) Maximize one central sphere: The pyramid\u2019s inradius is \u224839.64 m; thus the largest allowable central scan radius on the 0.5 m grid is R = 39.5 m, centered at (0,0,39.5). It is inside because its distance to each side plane is \u224839.72 m and to base is 39.5 m.\n\n2) Four corner spheres near the base: For a corner sphere tangent to the base (z0 = r) and two adjacent side faces, the center coordinate in x and y is x0 = y0 = 75 \u2212 (208.14/110) r \u2248 75 \u2212 1.892 r. To avoid overlapping the central sphere (non-overlap requires (x0^2 + y0^2) + (r \u2212 R)^2 \u2265 (r + R)^2, which reduces to x0^2 \u2265 2 r R), the feasible maximum with R = 39.5 is just under r \u2248 19.2. Choosing r = 19.0 m satisfies all constraints on the 0.5 m grid with centers at (\u00b139.0, \u00b139.0, 19.0). Each is within the faces [distance to each of the two adjacent faces \u2248 19.05 m \u2265 r] and disjoint from the central sphere [center distance \u2248 58.87 m > 58.5 m = r + R] and from each other (nearest neighbor center spacing \u2265 78 m > 38 m).\n\n3) One apex-region sphere on the axis: To maximize it without overlapping the central sphere, place it on the axis at the minimal height ensuring non-overlap: z_a = 2R + r_a. The side-plane clearance on-axis is (8250 \u2212 75 z)/133.14, so r_a \u2264 (8250 \u2212 150 R)/208.14 \u2248 11.17 m for R = 39.5. The largest 0.5 m step not exceeding this is r_a = 11.0 m. Set center at (0,0,90.0) (since 2R + r_a = 90.0); side-plane distance there is \u224811.27 m \u2265 r_a. This sphere is also far from all corner spheres.\n\nThus the six optimal scans (grid-aligned, non-overlapping, and fully inside) are:\n- Center: (0.0, 0.0, 39.5), r = 39.5 m\n- Corners: (\u00b139.0, \u00b139.0, 19.0), r = 19.0 m (four spheres, all sign combinations)\n- Apex: (0.0, 0.0, 90.0), r = 11.0 m\n\nThe maximum and minimum radii among these are 39.5 m and 11.0 m, respectively.\n\nAnswer: 39.5:11.0\nConfidence: 86%",

By (2), there is no proper subcontinuum containing {a,b}, hence in particular, no nowhere dense subcontinuum contains both a and b. Therefore a is not equivalent to b, so there are at least two equivalence classes.\n\n- Next, use (1) to observe that the relation \u223c is an equivalence relation: if x \u223c y and y \u223c z via nowhere dense subcontinua K and L, then K \u2229 L is connected and nonempty (contains y), so K \u222a L is a connected compact set (a subcontinuum), still nowhere dense (union of two nowhere dense sets), containing x and z. Hence x \u223c z.\n\n- For any x \u2208 X \\ {a,b}, let A_x be the (unique, by (1)) minimal subcontinuum containing {a,x}, and B_x the minimal subcontinuum containing {b,x}. If both A_x and B_x were nowhere dense, then A_x \u222a B_x would be a nowhere dense subcontinuum containing both a and b, contradicting (2). Thus for each x, at least one of A_x or B_x is not nowhere dense. On the other hand, if neither A_x nor B_x is nowhere dense, then a standard refinement (using (1) and minimality) produces a smaller subcontinuum that is nowhere dense and still contains {a,x} or {b,x}. Consequently, for every x, there exists a nowhere dense subcontinuum containing x together with exactly one of a or b. This shows that every x is equivalent to a or to b (and not to both, else again we would produce a nowhere dense subcontinuum containing a and b by union). Hence there are at most two equivalence classes.\n\nCombining the two bounds, the smallest possible number of \u223c-equivalence classes is 2.\n\nAnswer: 2\n\nConfidence: 58%",

In any bipartite d-regular graph on n vertices (with m = nd/2 edges), the number of 3-matchings can be counted from all 3-edge subsets by excluding those that are not pairwise disjoint. Classify an unordered triple of edges by how many pairs among them are adjacent (share a vertex):\n\n- Exactly 1 adjacent pair: pick a vertex v and two incident edges (n\u00b7C(d,2) choices), then pick a third edge disjoint from the three involved vertices; the number of edges touching those three vertices is 3d\u22122, so there are m \u2212 (3d \u2212 2) choices. Count = n\u00b7C(d,2)\u00b7(m \u2212 3d + 2).\n\n- Exactly 2 adjacent pairs: this is a 3-edge path; it is determined uniquely by its middle edge. For each edge, there are (d\u22121)^2 ways to extend to such a path. Count = m\u00b7(d\u22121)^2.\n\n- Exactly 3 adjacent pairs: this is a 3-star at a vertex; count = n\u00b7C(d,3).\n\nThus the number of 3-matchings is\nM3 = C(m,3) \u2212 n\u00b7C(d,2)\u00b7(m \u2212 3d + 2) \u2212 m\u00b7(d \u2212 1)^2 \u2212 n\u00b7C(d,3),\nwith m = nd/2. This depends only on n and d, not on the specific graph. For instance, when d = 2 this simplifies to M3 = n(n\u22124)(n\u22125)/6, independent of cycle structure; and for d = 3, n = 8 (both Q3 and K4,4 minus a perfect matching) gives M3 = 44 in both cases.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\nConfidence: 95%",

Hence, although A\u2032,B\u2032,C\u2032 depend on X, the orthocenter H\u2032 of \u0394A\u2032B\u2032C\u2032 is fixed; it is the orthopole of l with respect to \u0394ABC. Consequently, for all X the conic through A\u2032,B\u2032,C\u2032,O,H\u2032 is the same rectangular circumhyperbola of \u0394A\u2032B\u2032C\u2032, so its asymptote directions are independent of X and depend only on (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3) and the direction of l (i.e. \u03b4 = \u2220(BC,l)).\n\n- A circumconic of a triangle passing through its orthocenter is a rectangular hyperbola, and its asymptotes are isogonal images (with respect to the triangle) of a line through the triangle\u2019s circumcenter. Translating the isogonal action on directions into angles measured from BC shows that a global direction rotates by (\u03b2\u2212\u03b3)/2 under the (B,C)-isogonal \u201caverage\u201d: the bisector of the two isogonal images of any fixed direction (measured from BC) is obtained by adding (\u03b2\u2212\u03b3)/2. \n\n- Therefore, the bisector of the two (perpendicular) asymptotes is the line making angle \u03b4 + (\u03b2\u2212\u03b3)/2 with BC, and since the hyperbola is rectangular, the asymptotes are at \u00b145\u00b0 about this bisector.\n\nThus the two angles the asymptotes make with BC are:\n\u03b81 = \u03b4 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)/2 + \u03c0/4,\n\u03b82 = \u03b4 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)/2 \u2212 \u03c0/4.\n\nEquivalently, in degrees: \u03b81 = \u03b4 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)/2 + 45\u00b0, \u03b82 = \u03b4 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)/2 \u2212 45\u00b0.\n\nAnswer: The asymptotes are at angles \u03b4 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)/2 \u00b1 \u03c0/4 with respect to BC.\n\nConfidence: 38%",

If a comparison is unequal, you immediately learn which is real and which is fake; a known real then classifies any other bar in one weighing. An optimal strategy is to fix one bar and compare it to all others (up to 2n\u22121 comparisons). If any comparison is unequal, you can identify every bar by continuing to compare against the known real; if all comparisons are equal, then all bars are the same type, so the counts are not equal. This shows T(n) \u2264 2n\u22121.\n\nFor a matching lower bound, with fewer than 2n\u22121 comparisons the comparison graph on 2n bars is disconnected into at least two components. An adversary can answer so that all edges so far balance and the two components have size n and n, leaving both \u201cequal\u201d (one component all real, the other all fake) and \u201cnot equal\u201d (both components same type) possible; hence you cannot always decide with fewer than 2n\u22121 trials.

Mapping the heptad register gives Leu at a (positions 7, 14, 21, 28) and Ile at d (positions 3, 10, 17, 24). In knobs-into-holes packing, the identity of a- and d-position residues strongly biases oligomer state: Leu at a with beta-branched Ile at d optimally fits the threefold core geometry and is a well-known rule-of-thumb for trimeric coiled coils. Conversely, swapping (Ile at a, Leu at d) tends to favor tetramers. Thus, the L(a)/I(d) pattern predicts a trimer for maximal packing efficiency.\nAnswer: B. 3\nConfidence: 75%",

Then |d_Y(x0,x1) \u2212 d_X(1/2, y1)| \u2265 \u03c0 \u2212 1/2, hence dis(R) \u2265 \u03c0 \u2212 1/2. Therefore d_GH(X,Y) \u2265 (\u03c0 \u2212 1/2)/2.\n\n- Upper bound: Construct R by splitting S^1 into two semicircles A and A' with common endpoints p,q. Map A to [0, 1/2] linearly by arclength (scale 1/(2\u03c0)) sending p\u21a60, q\u21a61/2; map A' to [1/2,1] linearly by arclength sending q\u21a61/2, p\u21a61. Let R be the union of these two graphs. Then for any two pairs (x,y), (x',y') \u2208 R:\n  - If x,x' lie in the same semicircle, d_X(y,y') = (1/(2\u03c0)) d_Y(x,x'), so |d_Y \u2212 d_X| \u2264 \u03c0 \u2212 1/2.\n  - If x \u2208 A, x' \u2208 A', writing a,b for their arclengths from p (in A) and from q (in A'), one computes d_Y(x,x') = \u03c0 \u2212 |a \u2212 b| and d_X(y,y') = 1/2 + (|a \u2212 b|)/(2\u03c0). Hence |d_Y \u2212 d_X| = |(\u03c0 \u2212 1/2) \u2212 (1 + 1/(2\u03c0))|a \u2212 b|| \u2264 \u03c0 \u2212 1/2, with equality when a = b (midpoints of the semicircles).\n\nThus dis(R) = \u03c0 \u2212 1/2, giving d_GH(X,Y) \u2264 (\u03c0 \u2212 1/2)/2. Combining bounds yields\nd_GH([0,1], S^1) = (\u03c0 \u2212 1/2)/2 = \u03c0/2 \u2212 1/4.\n\nAnswer: \u03c0/2 \u2212 1/4\n\nConfidence: 88%",

This results from failure of the pleuroperitoneal membrane to close (Bochdalek hernia), allowing abdominal viscera to herniate into the thorax and compress the developing lung, causing respiratory distress and pulmonary hypoplasia. While pulmonary hypoplasia (A) is a consequence, the primary anatomical defect is the pleuroperitoneal membrane defect (B).

Since |P(X)| \u2264 |K(X)| = 2^{aleph0}, this lower bound is sharp. For example, taking all open dense sets equal to P(X) itself realizes size 2^{aleph0}.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection of countably many open dense subsets of P(X) is the continuum.\n\nAnswer: 2^{aleph0}\n\nConfidence: 62%",

            "response": "Explanation: In the standard Birkhoff description of a planar billiard with Ck, k \u2265 4, strictly convex boundary \u0393 parametrized by arc-length s \u21a6 \u03b3(s), the billiard map is generated by the \u201clength generating function\u201d H(s, s\u2032) = |\u03b3(s\u2032) \u2212 \u03b3(s)| (up to an irrelevant additive constant). Hence the small-separation asymptotics of H is the small-arc-length asymptotics of the chord length of a plane curve.\n\nLet \u0394 = s\u2032 \u2212 s and denote \u03c1 = |\u0394|. To make the expansion symmetric in s and s\u2032 (and thus automatically respect the symmetry H(s, s\u2032) = H(s\u2032, s)), it is convenient to expand around the midpoint s\u0304 = (s + s\u2032)/2 and use the Frenet frame T, N at s\u0304 with curvature \u03ba(s\u0304) and its derivatives. Writing the chord as an integral of the unit tangent, one obtains the chord vector\n\u03b3(s\u0304 + h) \u2212 \u03b3(s\u0304 \u2212 h) = \u222b\u2212h^h T(s\u0304 + u) du,  where h = \u03c1/2,\nand expanding T via the Frenet\u2013Serret formulas yields an even series for the squared chord length. A straightforward computation gives the expansion\nH(s, s\u2032) = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03ba(s\u0304)^2 \u03c1^3 / 24 + [ \u03ba(s\u0304)^4 / 1920 \u2212 \u03ba\u2032(s\u0304)^2 / 1440 \u2212 \u03ba(s\u0304) \u03ba\u2032\u2032(s\u0304) / 480 ] \u03c1^5 + O(\u03c1^7).\nSeveral features follow immediately:\n- Leading term: H \u223c \u03c1 = |s\u2032 \u2212 s|, i.e., the flat (zero-curvature) chord length.\n- First curvature correction: the O(\u03c1^3) term is \u2212\u03ba(s\u0304)^2 \u03c1^3 / 24. It depends only on \u03ba^2, not the sign of \u03ba, and is negative, reflecting that bending shortens chords relative to the arc.\n- Curvature variation enters only at O(\u03c1^5), via \u03ba\u2032 and \u03ba\u2032\u2032 at the midpoint. Thus, to leading order, only the local magnitude of curvature matters; spatial variation of curvature is a higher-order effect.\n- If one instead expands about s (one-sided), the same cubic correction \u2212\u03ba(s)^2 \u0394^3/24 appears, but an evenness-breaking O(\u0394^4) term \u221d \u03ba(s) \u03ba\u2032(s) arises; the midpoint expansion suppresses such terms and is the symmetric form naturally adapted to H(s, s\u2032).\n\nConnection to the symplectic/twist structure: The billiard map in Birkhoff coordinates is generated by p = \u2212\u2202s H, p\u2032 = \u2202s\u2032 H. As \u0394 \u2192 0, one has the familiar singular twist \u2202s\u2202s\u2032 H = \u22121/\u03c1 + O(\u03c1), with curvature supplying the first regular correction O(\u03c1). The cubic curvature correction above encodes the leading geometric influence of \u03ba on these derivatives and hence on the local twist of the billiard map.\n\nAnswer: Let \u03c1 = |s\u2032 \u2212 s| and s\u0304 = (s + s\u2032)/2. Then, as \u03c1 \u2192 0,\nH(s, s\u2032) = |\u03b3(s\u2032) \u2212 \u03b3(s)| = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03ba(s\u0304)^2 \u03c1^3 / 24 + [ \u03ba(s\u0304)^4 / 1920 \u2212 \u03ba\u2032(s\u0304)^2 / 1440 \u2212 \u03ba(s\u0304) \u03ba\u2032\u2032(s\u0304) / 480 ] \u03c1^5 + O(\u03c1^7).\nIn particular, the leading curvature dependence is\nH(s, s\u2032) = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03ba(s\u0304)^2 \u03c1^3 / 24 + o(\u03c1^3),\nshowing that curvature first enters at order \u03c1^3 through \u03ba^2(s\u0304), while spatial variation of curvature contributes only at order \u03c1^5 via \u03ba\u2032(s\u0304), \u03ba\u2032\u2032(s\u0304).\n\nConfidence: 86%",

There is no diffusion in the scalar equation, hence no genuine dissipative mechanism acting on \u03c1 or its derivatives. \n\nFor the x-derivative, differentiating the transport and using the Stokes equation gives\n(1/2) d/dt ||\u2202x\u03c1||_2^2 = \u2212||\u2207u_x||_2^2 \u2212 \u222b \u2202x\u03c1 (u_x \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8),\nwhere u_x solves a Stokes problem forced by \u2212\u2202x\u03c1 e_z. The first term is nonpositive, but the second (nonlinear) term has no definite sign. Moreover, the Stokes-to-force map has no spectral gap: high-frequency \u2202x\u03c1 produce very small ||\u2207u_x||, so there is no uniform coercivity to turn this into decay of ||\u2202x\u03c1||_2. Consequently, without diffusion or additional structure, one cannot obtain any uniform-in-time decay rate for ||\u2202x\u03c1||_2; in fact, it can stay O(1) or even grow, depending on the flow-induced mixing. \n\nThus, the best general time-decay you can expect for ||\u2202x\u03c1(t,\u00b7)||_{L^2} is no decay at all (i.e., at best an O(1) bound), and no uniform polynomial or exponential decay holds in this setting.\n\nAnswer: No decay (at best O(1); no uniform polynomial/exponential decay).\n\nConfidence: 63%",

For example, take any n and let s = floor(n/2)+1 with a family consisting of a single set (m=1). Then {P_1} is trivially linearly independent. More generally, linear dependence here is governed by dimension arguments tied to how we restrict/evaluate these polynomials (often modulo x_j^2\u2212x_j or after fixing x_n), not merely by s > n/2.\n- (b) Yes. For an ordered L-intersecting family with the partition index r (first r sets contain n, the rest do not) and nondecreasing sizes, consider evaluating P_i at x_n=1 for i \u2264 r and at x_n=0 for i > r, yielding polynomials Q_i in variables x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22121} of degree at most s. The ordered property guarantees a \u201ctriangular\u201d evaluation: Q_i vanishes on v_j|_{[n\u22121]} for i \u2260 j and is nonzero on its own vector, so the Q_i are linearly independent as functions on {0,1}^{n\u22121}. Hence m cannot exceed the dimension of the space of multilinear polynomials in n\u22121 variables of degree \u2264 s, which is \u2211_{i=0}^s binom(n\u22121, i).

Therefore no choice of K can make the mock feasible as stated. To make it feasible while keeping 61 sections and 1 m width, the first row radius would need to be at least r0 \u2265 1/(2\u03c0/61) \u2248 9.708 m; alternatively, with r0 = 3 m, you could have at most \u230a2\u03c0\u00b73/1\u230b = 18 sections.\n\n- Sightlines do not constrain K. Even ignoring the angular-width infeasibility, the standing speaker\u2019s head is 0.5 m higher than seated heads.

Each state yields two senators. With unanimous support only from S, you must be able to guarantee Senate passage of ordinary statutes (e.g., statehood/admission acts). With 25 states, you can elect 50 senators; together with a Vice President elected by your states (tie-breaker), you can pass bills in a 50\u201350 Senate. With fewer than 25 states you max out at 48 senators, so you cannot guarantee passage against unified opposition. The 51-month window covers the 2000, 2002, and 2004 Senate classes, so both seats in your 25 states can be captured by Jan 2005.\n  - Presidency and House are easier: a carefully chosen set of 25 populous states easily commands a majority of Electoral Votes (to elect the President/VP) and well over a majority of House seats (to pass ordinary statutes).\n\n- How 25 states can force an amendment within 51 months:\n  1) Choose S as 25 populous states. In Nov 2000, elect a President/VP and a House majority; begin flipping your states\u2019 Senate seats as they come up in 2000, 2002, 2004. By Jan 2005 you control 50 Senate seats; with your VP, you control the Senate for ordinary legislation.\n  2) Use Article IV, \u00a73 to admit/split states you control: with the consent of each coalition state legislature (which you have) and of Congress (which you control), pass an omnibus admission/splitting act creating enough new coalition-aligned states from your own states (and, if desired, Puerto Rico/DC) to push your coalition to at least three-fourths of all states.\n     - Let c be your initial coalition size (c=25), m the number of new coalition states you admit/split off. You need K = c + m \u2265 3/4 of N = 50 + m, i.e., 4(c + m) \u2265 3(50 + m) \u21d2 m \u2265 150 \u2212 4c. With c=25, m \u2265 50 suffices. For example, split coalition states to create 50 new states, yielding N=100 and K=75.\n  3) Propose and ratify:\n     - Either have 34 of your (now many) state legislatures apply for an Article V convention (forcing Congress to call it) and then have Congress select ratification by state legislatures; or, if desired, later use Congress itself to propose (the Senate supermajority becomes easy after adding many friendly senators; the House threshold can be managed by statute adjusting House size/apportionment, though the convention route avoids that bottleneck).\n     - Your 75 coalition state legislatures then ratify. Because you control at least three-fourths of the states, ratification succeeds even with total opposition elsewhere.\n  4) Timing: Elections (2000/2002/2004) seat your federal majorities by Jan 2005; admissions/splittings and ratifications can be scheduled within the 51-month window.\n\n- Why fewer than 25 cannot be \u201cstrong\u201d:\n  - With \u226424 states you cannot guarantee Senate control (\u226448 senators) and thus cannot force admission/splitting of new states against unified opposition. Without increasing the number of coalition states, you cannot reach the 34-state threshold to force a convention or the 38-state threshold to ratify solely with your own states. Therefore \u226424 cannot guarantee success \u201cdespite arbitrary opposition.\u201d\n\nAnswer: 25\n\nConfidence: 80%",

If some connected subset has nonempty interior in G, then its containing component must itself be open (a coset that contains a nonempty open subset is open). Applying the hypothesis with U = G gives that G has an open connected component, hence G^0 is open. Conversely, if G^0 is open, then for any neighborhood U of e, U \u2229 G^0 is a nonempty open subset of the connected space G^0, so one of its connected components is an open connected subset of G contained in Cl(U). Thus the given property is equivalent to G^0 being open.\n- With G^0 open, G is a disjoint union of open cosets of G^0. The total number of components of any subset of G is trivially at most |G| = c, so c is an upper bound for the number of non-open components of any open subset.\n- This bound is attained. Take a connected, not locally connected, Hausdorff topological group H of cardinality c (e.g., the one-dimensional solenoid). In such a space, there exists an open set whose component is not open (equivalently, failure of local connectedness). Let D be a discrete group of cardinality c and set G = H \u00d7 D. Then G has cardinality c, G^0 = H \u00d7 {e} is open, so G satisfies the hypothesis.

In particular, for Euclidean compacta this gives [X] = dim X + 1.\n\nUpper bound (\u2264 4): Take S to be the subbasis of open half-spaces in R^3 intersected with X = [0,1]^3 (i.e., sets of the form {x : \u2113(x) < a}\u2229X or {\u2113(x) > a}\u2229X for affine \u2113). If a cover by S had no 4-element subcover, then the complements (closed half-spaces intersected with X), which are convex subsets of R^3, would form a family whose every 4-fold intersection is nonempty but whose total intersection is empty. By Helly\u2019s theorem in R^3, this is impossible (apply Helly to finite subfamilies and use compactness of X). Hence every S-cover has a subcover of size \u2264 4, so [X] \u2264 4.\n\nLower bound (\u2265 4): If [X] \u2264 3, then by the dimension\u2013subbasis characterization above, we would have dim X \u2264 2.

The numeric claim is spurious.\n- 2) False. Wellesley did use local informants in India, but he also ran an effective intelligence system in the Peninsular War (e.g., Scovell\u2019s codebreaking, Spanish/Portuguese networks). The claim it was \u201cnever successfully implemented in European theaters\u201d is wrong.\n- 3) False. No 1815 army-wide standardization of a \u201crapid deployment\u201d structure derived from the Deccan occurred; the British Army remained fundamentally regimental, with divisional organization shaped by broader Napoleonic-era practice, not an Indian template.\n- 4) False. The Royal Military College (Sandhurst) originated in 1801 and moved to Sandhurst in 1812; Wellington neither founded it in 1829 nor did that date mark a curricular shift explicitly embedding \u201ccolonial lessons\u201d under his aegis.\n- 5) False. Indian logistical practice (magazines, local contracting, transport management) influenced later British military administration and Wellington\u2019s Peninsular methods; it certainly did not have \u201cno significant impact.\u201d\n- 6) False. The British had integrated local auxiliaries long before Wellington (e.g., 18th-century sepoy forces, North American auxiliaries). There is no solid documentary basis that \u201cWellington\u2019s methods\u201d specifically became the standard across Africa/SE Asia in the 1830s\u201340s.\n- 7) False. Wellington\u2019s commissariat reforms in the Peninsula were strongly informed by his Indian experience with local procurement, disciplined supply, and transport; they were not \u201centirely based on European theory.\u201d\n- 8) True. Wellesley used fast, self\u2011sufficient \u201cflying columns\u201d in India (notably against Dhoondiah Waugh). Variants of mobile columns were employed in the Peninsular War and are clearly documented in official records during the First Anglo\u2011Burmese War (1824\u20131826), where \u201cflying columns\u201d were used operationally.\n- 9) False. The 1813 Charter Act reforms turned chiefly on commercial/constitutional issues; there is no persuasive documentary trail showing they were \u201cdirectly influenced\u201d by Wellington\u2019s military organizational principles.\n- 10) False.

In high dimensions such martingales cannot be made to hit a given point with probability 1 by any adaptive choice among finitely many increment laws.\n\nThe key idea is a Lyapunov/superharmonic function argument. For d \u2265 3, the radial function r \u21a6 r^{2\u2212d} is harmonic for Brownian motion and \u201cnearly\u201d harmonic for any mean-zero, bounded-step walk. For any finite family of such step distributions that are genuinely d-dimensional, one can slightly perturb this radial function to obtain a positive function h on Z^d that is superharmonic for each of the finitely many kernels outside a large ball. Consequently, for any adaptive control, h(X_{n\u2227\u03c4}) is a supermartingale, where \u03c4 is the minimum of the return time to a small neighborhood of the origin and the exit time from a large ball. Optional stopping then yields a uniform bound strictly less than 1 on the probability to hit the origin before escaping to infinity. Letting the outer radius go to infinity shows that the probability of ever returning to the origin is strictly less than 1, regardless of the control strategy.\n\nIn particular, this holds for any finite k and any choice of the k measures. Hence there is no finite k for which one can guarantee (with probability 1) a return to the origin.\n\nAnswer: \u221e\nConfidence: 85%",

For coplanar points, this requires that they lie on a single circle (the sphere\u2019s center projects to the circle\u2019s center in the plane). The four square corners are concyclic with center (1,1) and radius \u221a2, but the fifth point (1,4) is distance 3 from (1,1), so it is not on that circle.

A free swap (distance 5) permutes elements only within the same residue class, so it lets us reorder each residue class arbitrarily at zero cost. Under full reversal, an element at position i must go to 101 \u2212 i, so modulo 5 we get r \u2192 1 \u2212 r (mod 5). Thus:\n- Class 3 stays in class 3 (0 steps).\n- Classes 0 and 1 swap (each element needs 1 \u00b11 step).\n- Classes 2 and 4 swap (each element needs 2 \u00b11 steps via class 3).\n\nThere are 20 elements in each class (since 100 is divisible by 5).

Arrange (using free within-class permutations) that the 3\u2019s used in the first set are exactly those produced by the second set, so class 3 ends restored, while each 2 advances to 4 and each 4 to 2 (2 steps each).

A Taylor expansion yields, for large n,\nE[V(X_{1}) \u2212 V(n) | X_0=n] = \u03b2[(\u03b2\u22121)/2 \u2212 2c] n^{\u03b2\u22122} + o(n^{\u03b2\u22122}).\nHence for any \u03b2 \u2208 (2, 4c+1) the drift is negative and of order n^{\u03b2\u22122}, i.e.\nPV(n) \u2212 V(n) \u2264 \u2212k V(n)^{1\u22122/\u03b2}\noutside a finite set. The polynomial Foster\u2013Lyapunov criterion then implies that the hitting time \u03c4 of 0 has finite moments of all orders \u03b1 < \u03b2/2. Letting \u03b2 \u2191 4c+1 gives E[\u03c4^\u03b1] < \u221e for all \u03b1 < 2c + 1/2.\n\nOptimality (divergence for larger \u03b1) follows from sharp Lamperti-type results for processes with asymptotically zero drift and bounded jumps (e.g., Aspandiiarov\u2013Iasnogorodski\u2013Menshikov, 1996; Menshikov\u2013Popov\u2013Wade, 2017), which identify the critical exponent as 1/2 + a, where a = lim_{n\u2192\u221e} n(\u2212m(n)) = 2c here. Thus E[\u03c4^\u03b1] = \u221e for \u03b1 \u2265 2c + 1/2.\n\nAs a check: when c=0 (simple symmetric case), the critical exponent is 1/2, consistent with P(\u03c4>t) ~ const\u00b7t^{-1/2} and E[\u03c4^\u03b1] finite iff \u03b1<1/2.\n\nAnswer: sup{\u03b1 : E[\u03c4^\u03b1] < \u221e} = 2c + 1/2\n\nConfidence: 76%",

For any probability distribution c = (c_p) on the primes (c_p \u2265 0, \u03a3_p c_p = 1), the completely multiplicative function \u03c6_c defined by \u03c6_c(p) = c_p and \u03c6_c(n) = \u220f_p c_p^{v_p(n)} is primitive, and any convex combination of such \u03c6_c is also primitive.\n\nFor any primitive f in this convex class (and thus for the whole class, since we can restrict to two-point mixtures to test inequalities), we have:\n- f(a) = E[\u03c6_C(a)], f(b) = E[\u03c6_C(b)], f(ab) = E[\u03c6_C(a) \u03c6_C(b)], where C is a random distribution on primes.\nLet X(C) = \u03c6_C(a) and Y(C) = \u03c6_C(b). For all two-point mixtures {C, D} with weights 1/2, the condition f(ab) \u2265 f(a) f(b) becomes\nE[XY] \u2212 E[X]E[Y] = 1/4 (X(C) \u2212 X(D))(Y(C) \u2212 Y(D)) \u2265 0.\nHence, for the inequality to hold for all primitive f, we must have (X(C) \u2212 X(D))(Y(C) \u2212 Y(D)) \u2265 0 for all choices of C, D. This forces X and Y to be comonotone over the simplex of prime distributions. That occurs if and only if X and Y depend on a single common coordinate C_p, i.e., both a and b are powers of the same prime p (including the trivial case where one is 1). Otherwise, pick two primes p | a and q | b with p \u2260 q (or redistribute weight among shared primes) to make X increase while Y decreases, violating the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the allowed ordered pairs (a, b) are exactly those where either a = 1 or b = 1, or both a and b are powers of the same prime.\n\nCounting such pairs for 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 1000:\n- Pairs with a = 1 or b = 1: 2\u00b71000 \u2212 1 = 1999 (subtracting (1,1) counted twice).\n- For each prime p \u2264 1000, let t_p be the number of prime powers p^k \u2264 1000 with k \u2265 1. Then the number of ordered pairs (a, b) with a, b \u2265 2 both powers of p is t_p^2.

To satisfy the global condition for every orientation, we must have, for all i and all subsets S not containing i, sum(S) \u2260 w_i. In particular, no label can equal the sum of two other labels, so the label set must be sum-free.\n\nA classical extremal result states that the largest sum-free subset of {1, \u2026, k} has size ceil(k/2), attained by the \u201ctop half\u201d {\u230ak/2\u230b+1, \u2026, k}.

The dilation generator D \u221d x\u00b7p + p\u00b7x does not commute with H even for V \u221d 1/r\u00b2; rather [D, H] is proportional to H (up to constants).

This fits a receptor/co-receptor pair model for AKP1 and RIB3 for flagpep140-168.\nProtein interaction and localization data support these roles:\n- Split-luc: KIB1 interacts with AKP1 and YKL23, but not with RIB3, consistent with KIB1 acting as a downstream signaling adaptor recruited by ligand-activated receptors.\n- GFP localization: KIB1 translocates from PM to nucleus upon MAMP treatment (flagpep140-168 in tobacco, which has endogenous perception), supporting a downstream signaling role. AKP1, RIB3, and YKL23 remain at the plasma membrane, consistent with receptor/co-receptor roles.\n\nThus, RIB3 functions as the co-receptor of AKP1 for flagpep140-168, and KIB1 acts downstream in signaling. Option E is incorrect because even though KIB1 doesn\u2019t interact with RIB3 directly, RIB3 is still part of the upstream receptor complex that activates KIB1 via AKP1.\n\nAnswer: C\nConfidence: 85%",

Any axis-aligned unit square S can intersect at most four of these grid squares, and the total intersection area is 1. Hence at least one of the four intersections has area at least 1/4. This construction achieves r = 1/4, and this is tight for this partition (e.g., when S is centered at a grid vertex, the four overlaps are all exactly 1/4).\n\n- Upper bound (optimality): One cannot force a larger guaranteed overlap than 1/4 for all axis-aligned unit squares, regardless of how the 16 unit-area pieces are drawn. Intuitively, for any decomposition, one can place an axis-aligned unit square so that no single piece occupies more than a quarter of its area. A standard way to formalize this is to choose a vertical unit-width strip and a horizontal unit-width strip that minimize the maximum (over pieces) area captured in the strip; then take their intersection S. For each piece P, the area in S is at most the geometric mean of its areas in the two strips (Cauchy\u2013Schwarz/Fubini), so it is bounded by the product of the two maxima. Since the total area in any unit-width strip is 4 and there are 16 pieces, one cannot make both strip-maxima exceed 1/4 simultaneously in a way that would force a uniform improvement over 1/4 in S for all placements. Consequently, no decomposition can guarantee a strictly larger r.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible r is 1/4.\n\nAnswer: 1/4\n\nConfidence: 65%",

The condition that for every x\u22600 the vectors A_1x,\u2026,A_nx are linearly independent is equivalent to: for every y\u22600, the matrix M(y) is invertible. Indeed, for fixed x\u22600 the map y\u21a6M(y)x is injective iff {A_i x} are independent; hence if some M(y) were singular for y\u22600, we would get a nonzero x with M(y)x=0, contradicting independence.\n\nDefine a bilinear multiplication on R^n by y\u22c5x := M(y)x = \u03a3 y_i A_i x. The above equivalence implies that for every y\u22600, left multiplication L_y:x\u21a6y\u22c5x is invertible, and for every x\u22600, right multiplication R_x:y\u21a6y\u22c5x is invertible. Thus we obtain a finite-dimensional real (two-sided) division algebra structure on R^n (bilinear, with left and right division).\n\nBy the classical classification (Hurwitz/Bott\u2013Milnor\u2013Kervaire/Adams), the only possible dimensions of a finite-dimensional real division algebra are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Therefore such matrices can exist only for n\u2208{1,2,4,8}.\n\nConversely, for n=1,2,4,8, take the normed division algebras R, C, H, O, and let A_i be left multiplication by a fixed real basis element e_i (including 1). Then for any x\u22600, the vectors A_i x = e_i x are linearly independent because in a division algebra right multiplication by x is invertible: if \u03a3 y_i e_i x = 0, then \u03a3 y_i e_i = 0.\n\nHence there are exactly four such n.\n\nAnswer: 4\nConfidence: 73%",

Then\nW'(x) = h'(x) \u2212 1 = f'(g(x))\u00b7g'(x) \u2212 1.\n\nSince f and g are cubic and strictly increasing, their derivatives f' and g' are positive quadratics with no real roots. Thus we can write\nf'(y) = a(y \u2212 \u03b1)^2 + m and g'(x) = b(x \u2212 \u03b2)^2 + n\nwith a, b, m, n > 0.

P is the product of two U-shaped functions, so it has at most two local minima and one local maximum; equivalently, P'(x) has at most three real zeros. Therefore the horizontal line y = 1 can meet y = P(x) in at most four points, i.e., the equation W'(x) = 0 has at most 4 real solutions. By Rolle\u2019s theorem, W(x) can then have at most 5 real zeros. Hence f(g(x)) has at most 5 fixed points.\n\nThis bound is attainable: choose f and g so that S and T have well-separated minima and are scaled so that P dips below 1 at both minima but rises above 1 between them; then W' has four simple zeros and, after adjusting the constant term of f, W has five simple zeros. For example, taking f(y) = \u03b5(y^3 + 6y^2 + 15y) + c and g(x) = \u03b4(x^3 \u2212 6x^2 + 15x) with small \u03b5, \u03b4 > 0 (so f'(y) = \u03b5[3(y+2)^2 + 3], g'(x) = \u03b4[3(x\u22122)^2 + 3]) yields two distinct minima of P; suitable \u03b5, \u03b4, c make the described configuration, giving 5 fixed points.\n\nAnswer: 5\nConfidence: 62%",

Using the long exact sequence for the pair (W_r(k),(p)) and Quillen\u2019s result K_{2n}(F_p) = 0 for n \u2265 1, it follows that K_{2n}(W_r(k)) = 0 for all n \u2265 1.

Two facts are relevant.\n\n1) Realizability of \u201cmany\u201d fixed points: Take f(x) = x + 1. Its restriction to the closed discrete subset \u2124 \u2282 \u211d is the shift n \u21a6 n + 1. The induced map \u03b2f fixes every minimal idempotent ultrafilter p on \u03b2\u2124 (they satisfy p + 1 = p), and there are 2^{2^{\u21350}} such ultrafilters, all lying in \u03b2\u2124 \\ \u2124, which is a closed subspace of R*. Hence F has 2^{2^{\u21350}} fixed points in the remainder.\n\n2) Minimality: A standard result (proved via ultrafilter/Boolean-algebra methods; see e.g. Hindman\u2013Strauss, Algebra in the Stone\u2013\u010cech Compactification) says that for a Tychonoff space of weight c (like \u211d), if the Stone\u2013\u010cech extension \u03b2f has any fixed point in the remainder, then in fact it has 2^{2^{\u21350}} of them. Intuitively, once one nonprincipal ultrafilter is fixed, there is a vast independent family of invariant clopen sets allowing the construction of 2^{2^{\u21350}} distinct fixed ultrafilters. In particular, you cannot have only finitely or merely continuum many fixed points in R*: the fixed-point set in the remainder is either empty or of cardinal 2^{2^{\u21350}}.\n\nCombining (1) and (2), the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points of F in the Stone\u2013\u010cech remainder is 2^{2^{\u21350}}.\n\nAnswer: 2^{2^{\u21350}}\n\nConfidence: 62%",

A long superconducting tube with open ends strongly shields the bore from axial fields and does not transmit the dipole\u2019s flux to the far end; the far-end field is reduced relative to air.\n- A ferromagnetic core wrapped by a superconducting shell is still shielded by the shell, so the core cannot collect and guide flux; far-end field is reduced.\n- A superconducting core with a ferromagnetic shell still provides a high-\u03bc path in the shell; the SC core just blocks the center and pushes flux into the shell. The shell can guide flux to the far end, giving enhancement over air (though typically less than a solid ferromagnetic cylinder of the same outer radius because the available cross-sectional area for flux is smaller).\n- Air is the baseline with no guiding or shielding.\n\nRanking of far-end field strength (strongest to weakest): \n1 (solid ferromagnet) > 4 (SC core + ferromagnetic shell) > 5 (air) >> 2 (SC tube) \u2248 3 (ferromagnetic core + SC shell).\n\nAnswer: 1 and 4 (with 1 strongest, then 4; 2 and 3 suppress; 5 is baseline)\n\nConfidence: 82%",

Non\u2011solicitation clauses remain permissible if reasonable.\n- Bryan: As CEO, he falls within the ESA\u2019s \u201cexecutive\u201d exception, so his non\u2011compete can be valid if reasonable. A 6\u2011month Ontario\u2011wide non\u2011compete tied to the same industry is likely reasonable for a senior executive. His one\u2011year client non\u2011solicitation is also likely reasonable and enforceable, particularly given his senior role and access to client relationships and strategy.\n- Ryan: He is a Shift Manager, not an executive, so his non\u2011compete is void under the ESA. His non\u2011solicitation is assessed at common law. Given his purely production role (no client\u2011facing duties) and the clause\u2019s breadth (prohibiting solicitation of any B&R client, not just those he had dealings with), a court would likely find no legitimate proprietary interest justifying the restraint and/or that it is overbroad, rendering it unenforceable against him.\n- New hires (20 manufacturing employees): They are non\u2011executive employees hired on February 1, 2022, so any non\u2011compete in their agreements is void under the ESA. That does not invalidate the entire employment agreements; the offending clause is simply unenforceable. Other terms (including any reasonable non\u2011solicit) remain generally enforceable.\n- Pickup truck: Bryan\u2019s promise to gift his personally owned truck to Stan was gratuitous (no consideration) and not under seal, and there is no evidence of detrimental reliance by Stan. It is therefore not an enforceable contract. Bryan is not legally required to transfer the truck.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nConfidence: 78%",

Briefly:\n- If one point lies inside the triangle formed by the other three, that interior point is inside their circumcircle, and none of the others is inside any of the other three circumcircles.\n- If the four points form a convex quadrilateral, use the angle\u2013chord criterion: for opposite vertices D and B, exactly one of \u201cD is inside circ(ABC)\u201d or \u201cB is inside circ(ACD)\u201d holds (the subtended angle from inside a circumcircle is larger than the angle on the circle). A similar consideration for the other pair shows that, overall, exactly one of the four points is inside the circumcircle of the other three.\n\nBy symmetry (exchangeability of the four i.i.d. points), each point is equally likely to be that unique \u201cinside-the-circumcircle\u201d point.

Each iteration that maximizes the expected intrinsic reward is thus a greedy step on the linearized objective, pushing probability mass toward states that were under-visited previously. Individual iterates \u03c0^k generally do not maximize H(s) (and the limit may not exist due to cycling). However, the mixture over all iterates\u2014i.e., averaging the policies across iterations\u2014corresponds to averaging the induced state distributions, which converges to the entropy-maximizing distribution (uniform over reachable states) under standard no-regret/Frank\u2013Wolfe arguments. Hence the ensemble (sum/mixture) over all \u03c0^k maximizes H(s).\nAnswer: D\nConfidence: 64%",

Acylation at oxygen withdraws electron density from the allylic system, shifting the nearby vinylic proton downfield (from ~5.34 to ~5.97 ppm). It also renders the C1 methylene protons diastereotopic, so the single vinylic proton at C2 now couples differently to each, giving a doublet of doublets.

To find the pre-image of a desired output E_out, you must apply S^{-1} = F1^{-1} \u00b7 T^{-1} \u00b7 F2^{-1}. Merely \u201cpropagating through free space and then T^{-1}\u201d works only if those free-space steps are the exact inverses of the original ones and applied in reverse order.\n\n- Adding a birefringent layer B changes the system to S' = F3 \u00b7 B \u00b7 F2 \u00b7 T \u00b7 F1. Birefringence mixes polarization (and can couple polarization to spatial/OAM modes via spin\u2013orbit effects). The correct inverse is S'^{-1} = F1^{-1} \u00b7 T^{-1} \u00b7 F2^{-1} \u00b7 B^{-1} \u00b7 F3^{-1}. If you ignore B or treat the problem with a scalar (single-polarization) transmission matrix, the inversion generally fails.\n\n- When does it still work? In principle it still holds if:\n  1) You model the full vectorial operator (a 2\u00d72 Jones-transmission matrix over the spatial mode basis, i.e., a block matrix that includes cross-polarization and spatial coupling), \n  2) You can control and measure both polarization components (and the relevant spatial modes), \n  3) The system is linear, stationary, reciprocal (no Faraday rotators), and not rank-deficient from polarization-dependent loss. Otherwise, the inverse is ill-posed and only a pseudo-inverse/approximate pre-compensation is possible.\n\n- Practical failure modes with a birefringent layer:\n  - Using a scalar T^{-1} while the system mixes H/V (or spin\u2013orbit) \u2192 wrong inverse.\n  - Polarization-dependent loss/singular modes \u2192 non-invertible or unstable inversion.\n  - Time-varying polarization or medium \u2192 the measured inverse no longer matches.\n  - Limited hardware (single-polarization SLM/detector) \u2192 incomplete control/measurement.\n\nSo yes, adding a birefringent layer can break the simple \u201capply T^{-1} after free space\u201d prescription unless you include that layer in the transmission model and invert the full vector operator in the correct reverse order.\n\nAnswer: Yes\u2014if you add birefringence and don\u2019t include it in a full vector (polarization-aware) transmission matrix and invert that composite operator in reverse order, the simple theory will fail. It can still hold in principle only if you model and invert the full vectorial system and have full polarization control.\n\nConfidence: 82%",

This profile is a mutual best response and, after the standard disentangling and measurement, yields the effective outcome of mutual cooperation, giving payoffs (5,5). This Pareto-dominates the classical equilibrium (Defect, Defect) = (1,1). Note: if one allows unrestricted SU(2) strategies, pure-strategy equilibria may not exist; the (Q,Q) equilibrium holds under the usual restricted strategy set with maximal entanglement.\nAnswer: (Q, Q) \u2192 effective (Cooperate, Cooperate) with payoff (5,5)\nConfidence: 83%",

Hence\n  Q(m) = (2\u03c0)^{\u03c6(m)/2} for m having at least two distinct primes, and Q(p^a) = (2\u03c0)^{\u03c6(p^a)/2} p^{\u22121/2}.\n- Therefore\n  P(n) = (2\u03c0)^{(1/2)\u2211_{b=2}^{n} \u03c6(b) \u230an/b\u230b} \u00d7 \u220f_{p}\\prod_{a\u22651, p^a\u2264n} p^{\u2212(1/2)\u230an/p^a\u230b}.\n  The prime-power part is (n!)^{\u22121/2} by Legendre\u2019s formula \u2211_{a\u22651} \u230an/p^a\u230b = \u03bd_p(n!).

In N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide, both the amide carbonyl (via O\u2013Li coordination) and the dimethylamino group (via N\u2013Li coordination) strongly direct metalation to positions ortho to themselves. The positions ortho to both groups are C2 and C4, but bidentate chelation preferentially stabilizes deprotonation at C2 (the position between the two substituents). The resulting aryllithium at C2 is then trapped by methyl iodide to give C\u2013Me formation. Thus, methylation occurs at C2, yielding the 2-methyl derivative.\nAnswer: N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide\nConfidence: 85%",

Such x_0 are preimages (under f^q) of points on periodic orbits of period p. For a real-analytic, non-constant map on an interval, each periodic orbit is a finite set, and for each fixed q the preimage of a point under f^q is finite. Therefore, for each pair (q, p) with q + p = 7, the set of x_0 producing exactly those 7 distinct values is at most countable.

This lower bound is achieved by choosing exactly one nonzero vector from each 1-dimensional subspace (and lifting to 7G), which also hits every order-49 cyclic subgroup via their unique order-7 subgroup.\n\nAnswer: (7^{2024} \u2212 1)/6\n\nConfidence: 92%",

The junction action can only depend on that final memory state.\n- We seek the smallest n for which there exist two corridor-specific observation strings of length n that:\n  (i) cannot be mapped to different final states by any 2-state DFA (so m=2 cannot beat memoryless), yet\n  (ii) can be mapped to different final states by some 3-state DFA (so m=3 can beat memoryless).\n- For binary input and 2 states, there are only 16 possible transition pairs (\u03b4_0, \u03b4_1), where each \u03b4_a is one of {I (identity), F (flip), Z (constant 0), O (constant 1)} on {0,1}. A 2-state controller\u2019s final state from start 0 on an input string is determined by composing these functions along the string.\n- Length n=1,2,3: Any pair of distinct strings can be separated by some 2-state DFA. Sketch:\n  - If last bits differ, choose \u03b4_0=Z, \u03b4_1=O (final state equals last bit).\n  - If last bits are same but parity of ones differs, choose \u03b4_0=I, \u03b4_1=F (final equals parity of ones).\n  - For length 3, the only remaining pairs (same last bit and same parity) are among {100,010,001} (if last bit 0) or {011,101,110} (if last bit 1); these are separated by \u03b4_0=F, \u03b4_1=Z or \u03b4_0=Z, \u03b4_1=F (order-sensitive \u201ctoggle/reset\u201d).\n  Hence, for n\u22643, a 2-state controller can always exploit the observations, so there is no environment where m=3 helps while m=2 doesn\u2019t.\n- Length n=4: There exist pairs indistinguishable by every 2-state DFA but distinguishable by a 3-state DFA. A concrete pair is:\n  - C1: 0 1 1 0\n  - C2: 1 0 1 0\n  One can verify (by enumerating all 16 choices of (\u03b4_0, \u03b4_1) \u2208 {I,F,Z,O}\u00d7{I,F,Z,O}) that both strings yield the same final state from start 0 for every 2-state DFA; e.g., they agree under last-bit, parity-of-ones, \u201ctoggle-on-0/reset-on-1,\u201d etc. Thus no 2-state machine can separate them at the junction.\n- A 3-state controller can separate them. For example, with states S (start), A, C:\n  - \u03b4(S,0)=A, \u03b4(S,1)=C\n  - \u03b4(A,1)=A, \u03b4(C,0)=C\n  - \u03b4(A,1)=A, then \u03b4(A,0)=A (so 0110 ends in A)\n  - \u03b4(C,1)=B (reuse a third state B), \u03b4(B,0)=C (so 1010 ends in C)\n  Completing the table arbitrarily for unused pairs yields a 3-state DFA in which 0110 and 1010 end in different states, enabling the agent to choose different actions and get reward 1 with certainty if the reward grants +1 for choosing a1 in C1 and a2 in C2 (and 0 otherwise).\n- Therefore, with reward R(s_1^J,a_1)=R(s_2^J,a_2)=1 and 0 otherwise, a memoryless (m=1) or 2-state controller can do no better than chance (expected return 0.5 under equal priors), while a 3-state controller can achieve return 1. Since for n\u22643 such an example is impossible, the minimal n is 4.\n\nAnswer: n = 4\n\nConfidence: 85%",

So the question depends only on the indices 1,2,\u2026,4m+2.\n\n- Let n_r be the number of remaining indices congruent to r modulo 4 (r=0,1,2,3). Any 4-term AP of indices with step r has one of the following residue-use patterns mod 4:\n  \u2022 r\u22611 or 3: uses each residue 0,1,2,3 exactly once.\n  \u2022 r\u22612: uses two residues of the same parity, each twice (either {0,2} or {1,3}).\n  \u2022 r\u22610: uses four copies of a single residue.\n  Hence in any partition of the remaining indices into 4-APs, the parities of n_0,n_1,n_2,n_3 must be all equal.\n\n- Initially for 1..4m+2 we have (n_0,n_1,n_2,n_3)=(m, m+1, m+1, m). After removing two indices, parity-equality of (n_0,n_1,n_2,n_3) forces the removed residues modulo 4 to be either the pair (1,2) or the pair (3,0). A further (standard) extremal argument from the left end shows (3,0) is impossible (since 1 must be present, the leftmost group would force an incompatible use of residue-classes 0 and 3), so the only possible residue pair is (1,2).\n\n- Conversely, if i\u22611 (mod 4) and j\u22612 (mod 4) with i<j, write i=4a+1 and j=4b+2 (0\u2264a\u2264b\u2264m). Then we can explicitly partition the remaining indices into m disjoint blocks of 4 consecutive integers (which are 4-term APs with step 1) by choosing the starts s_t as:\n  \u2022 s_t=4t+1 for t=0,1,\u2026,a\u22121,\n  \u2022 s_t=4t+2 for t=a,a+1,\u2026,b\u22121,\n  \u2022 s_t=4t+3 for t=b,b+1,\u2026,m\u22121.\n  These m disjoint 4-blocks cover all indices except exactly i=4a+1 and j=4b+2. Thus every pair with residues (1,2) (in increasing order) works.\n\n- Therefore, the favorable (i,j) with i<j are exactly those with i=4a+1, j=4b+2 and 0\u2264a\u2264b\u2264m. The number of such pairs is \u2211_{b=0}^m (b+1)=(m+1)(m+2)/2. The total number of pairs (i,j) with i<j from 1..4m+2 is C(4m+2,2)=(4m+2)(4m+1)/2.\n\n- Hence the desired probability is\n  P_m = [(m+1)(m+2)/2] / [ (4m+2)(4m+1)/2 ]\n      = (m+1)(m+2) / [ (4m+2)(4m+1) ].\n\nAnswer: P_m = (m+1)(m+2) / [(4m+2)(4m+1)]\n\nConfidence: 77%",

As soon as one operand is float, Python uses true division; a/float(b) and float(a)/b perform the same float division (across versions).\n- D: False. In Python 3, -7 // 3 == -3 while int(-7/3) == int(-2.333...) == -2.\n- E: True. In Python 3, \u201c/\u201d on ints converts to floats and divides; explicitly converting both to float yields the same result.\n- F: True. With any float operand, \u201c//\u201d returns a float; 5.0 // 2 -> 2.0 in both Python 2 and 3.\n- G: True. The Euclidean identity (n//m)*m + n%m == n holds for integers in both versions (with m != 0; they stated positive).\n- H: False. Floor division floors toward -inf: -3.0 // 2.0 == -2.0 but -(3.0 // 2.0) == -1.0.\n- I: False. a/b and a*(1.0/b) can differ due to floating-point rounding (two ops vs one).\n- J: True. In Python 3, \u201c/\u201d always returns float, regardless of whether the mathematical result is an integer.\n- K: True. Floor division (//) rounds toward negative infinity for negatives in both Python 2 and 3.\n- L: True. In Python 3, n/1 is float n, so (n/1) - n evaluates to 0.0 (numerically 0), with float vs int types differing.\n- M: True. With integer a,b,c, both (a/b)/c and a/(b*c) use the same operator \u201c/\u201d: in Python 2 they both yield int/long; in Python 3 they both yield float. If they\u2019re numerically equal, their result types still match within a given version.\n- N: False. Counterexample in Python 3: x=1, y=2 \u2192 sum([x/y]*y) = 0.5+0.5 = 1.0 equals x though 1 is not divisible by 2.\n- O: False. Floating-point: (1/3)+(1/3)+(1/3) \u2248 0.9999999999999999 in Python 3; in Python 2 it\u2019s 0.\n\nAnswer: A, B, C, E, F, G, J, K, L, M\n\nConfidence: 86%",

Beam search with b=1 is equivalent to greedy decoding regardless of ties (given identical tie-breaking and no extra scoring like length penalties). \n- C: True. Increasing temperature (\u03c4 > 1) flattens the distribution, so top-p may need more tokens to reach p, including tokens previously outside the original top-p set. \n- E: True. Truncation (top-k/top-p) followed by renormalization preserves relative probability ratios among the retained tokens for any fixed \u03c4. \n- F: False. A suitably large k can exclude less total mass than 1 \u2212 p; thus nucleus can exclude more mass than top-k. \n- G: False. Order matters: top-k then top-p (or vice versa) uses different renormalizations and can yield different sets. \n- H: False. Compared to greedy, beam search (especially with diversity penalties) does not \u201ctypically reduce\u201d diversity; if anything, it tends to increase the set of distinct outputs returned. \n- I: False. Lower temperature (\u03c4 < 1) makes distributions peakier, increasing the chance beams collapse to identical paths. \n- J: False. Length normalization mitigates but does not eliminate beam convergence to the same output. \n- K: False. Penalizing repeats modifies specific token logits; lowering temperature scales all logits. Not equivalent. \n- L: False. With p=1, nucleus includes the full support and is identical to standard multinomial sampling regardless of ties. \n- M: False. Setting torch.manual_seed() alone does not guarantee determinism with MoE; CUDA kernel nondeterminism, routing tie-breaks, and other factors can still vary results. \n- N: False. There is no universal monotonic relationship between model depth and variance of nucleus sampling outputs. \n- O: True. Different GPU architectures can change floating-point accumulation order and kernel implementations, leading to different beam paths even with fixed seeds and fp32. \n- P: True. If experts are pruned differently across runs, the logits (and thus cumulative mass ordering) change, so a fixed p can select different token sets. \n- Q: False. Even with deterministic routing, identical outputs do not strictly require identical attention patterns (they could coincidentally match); the \u201conly if\u201d is too strong. \n- R: True. Padding/masking and shape-dependent kernels can induce nondeterministic numerical differences with fixed seeds, changing outputs. \n- S: False. A mixture distribution can have higher entropy than any constituent model; it\u2019s not bounded by the deepest model\u2019s entropy. \n- T: False. Quantization can alter token rankings; it does not \u201cpreserve\u201d them in general. \n- W: False.

For any compact interval J \u2282 R, the restriction f|_J is a continuous injective map from a compact space into a Hausdorff space, hence a homeomorphism onto its image; thus f(J) is a topological arc in X.\n\nThe given separation property says: for each x \u2260 y in X there exists a closed connected K with x \u2208 Int_X(K) \u2282 X \\ {y}. In particular, for each x, there is a connected open neighborhood of x contained in some closed connected set. Combining this with the arcs coming from images of compact intervals, we get that every point of X has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open interval. Thus X is a 1-manifold without boundary.\n\nA connected 1-manifold without boundary is homeomorphic to either R or S^1. But S^1 cannot occur here: a continuous injective map R \u2192 S^1 between 1-manifolds is an open embedding (invariance of domain for 1-manifolds), so its image is an open arc, not all of S^1; hence no continuous injective surjection R \u2192 S^1 exists. Therefore X must be homeomorphic to R (equivalently, to any open interval).\n\nThus there is exactly one homeomorphism class.\n\nAnswer: 1 (represented by R)\n\nConfidence: 68%",

Hence, the number of embeddings is at least |B| = K whenever it is nonzero. On the other hand, since X is finite, the total number of maps X \u2192 B is at most K^{|X|} = K (for infinite K), so there cannot be more than K embeddings.

Define, for subsets X,Y \u2286 Q,\nX ~ Y iff X embeds homeomorphically into Y and Y embeds homeomorphically into X (i.e., each is homeomorphic to a subspace of the other). This is an equivalence relation (reflexive and symmetric by definition; transitive by composing embeddings).\n\nUpper bound: The total number of subsets of Q is 2^\u21350, so there are at most 2^\u21350 equivalence classes.\n\nLower bound (construction of continuum many pairwise non\u2013bi-embeddable classes): Build a family {X_A : A \u2286 N} of subspaces of Q so that\nX_A embeds into X_B \u21d4 A \u2286* B (i.e., A \u2286 B modulo finitely many exceptions).\nSketch of X_A: Fix a rational point p \u2208 Q. Around p choose a nested neighborhood base (U0 \u2283 U1 \u2283 \u2026) of clopen sets with \u22c2n Un = {p} and with each \u201cannulus\u201d Un \\ Un+1 separating cleanly from the others. For each n:\n- If n \u2209 A, place inside Un \\ Un+1 a single \u201carm\u201d: a copy of a convergent sequence whose only accumulation point (in X_A) is p (so X_A \\ {p} has exactly one component in that annulus).\n- If n \u2208 A, place inside Un \\ Un+1 two disjoint arms, both converging to p (so X_A \\ {p} has exactly two components in that annulus).\nThis can be done within Q by using pairwise disjoint rational \u201cthreads\u201d approaching p.\n\nKey invariant: For each n, let k_A(n) be the number (1 or 2) of components of (X_A \u2229 (Un \\ Un+1)) after removing p. Any topological embedding f: X_A \u2192 X_B must send p to the unique non-isolated point of X_B and, by continuity at p, eventually map each annulus Un \\ Un+1 into some deeper annulus Vm(n) \\ Vm(n)+1 of X_B, with m(n) strictly increasing. Hence, for all sufficiently large n, we have k_A(n) \u2264 k_B(m(n)). This yields A \u2286* B. Conversely, if A \u2286* B, one can define an embedding respecting the annuli for all sufficiently large n. Thus X_A embeds into X_B iff A \u2286* B.\n\nNow choose a family {A_r : r \u2208 {0,1}^N} with pairwise incomparable members under \u2286* (for example, partition N into infinitely many disjoint infinite intervals I_k and let A_r = \u22c3{I_k : r(k)=1}). Then for r \u2260 s, neither A_r \u2286* A_s nor A_s \u2286* A_r, so X_{A_r} and X_{A_s} do not embed into each other. Hence we have 2^\u21350 pairwise non\u2013bi-embeddable subsets of Q.\n\nTherefore there are at least 2^\u21350 equivalence classes, and at most 2^\u21350 classes. So the number of equivalence classes is exactly 2^\u21350.\n\nAnswer: Continuum many (2^\u21350) equivalence classes.\n\nConfidence: 70%",

A convenient way is to produce an implication waiting to consume one C_r. Having S_l, we derive a resource that \u201cuses up\u201d a C_r to continue with S_nz. This is modeled by S_nz \u2297 (C_r \u22b8 1): the implication C_r \u22b8 1 will consume exactly one C_r and contribute trivially (1) to the tensor, thus decrementing r by one without affecting other counters.\n\n- Zero branch (x_r = 0): we must jump to z without changing the counters. We also introduce a special token Z_r that certifies the zero-test. The axioms in \u0394 ensure Z_r can eliminate any C_j for j \u2260 r (by !(Z_r \u2297 C_j \u22b8 Z_r)) and can be finally discarded (by !(Z_r \u22b8 1)), but crucially there is no way to eliminate a C_r using Z_r. Thus if we wrongly choose the zero branch when a C_r is present, that C_r cannot be discharged by Z_r and the derivation cannot be completed to 1. Hence the zero branch is only viable when x_r = 0.\n\nWe combine the two cases by an additive choice (\u2295) inside the instruction body, which captures the machine\u2019s branching at a JZDEC:\n\n- If x_r > 0, we can apply the first summand to consume one C_r (via C_r \u22b8 1) and move to S_nz.\n- If x_r = 0, the second summand yields S_z together with Z_r, enabling the zero branch and allowing Z_r to be eventually discharged (and to ignore other non-r counters if needed) via \u0394.\n\nWith this F, a sequent proof mirrors a run of the Minsky machine, and conversely any cut-free proof provides the corresponding accepting run: INC-steps add a C_r; JZDEC-steps either consume one C_r and go to nz or (only when no C_r is present) go to z and introduce Z_r; reaching S_final allows us to close using !(S_final \u22b8 1). The \u0394 axioms guarantee that Z_r behaves exactly as a \u201czero certificate\u201d for register r and cannot remove any C_r, enforcing correctness of the zero test.\n\nAnswer: F(r,z,nz) = (S_{nz} \u2297 (C_r \u22b8 1)) \u2295 (S_{z} \u2297 Z_r)\n\nConfidence: 62%",

With mild additional assumptions (linearity, homogeneity of space and time, spatial isotropy, reciprocity), one can show that transformations between inertial frames form a one-parameter family characterized by a constant k:\n- k = 0 \u2192 Galilean relativity (infinite invariant speed; no time dilation/length contraction).\n- k > 0 \u2192 Lorentz-type relativity with a finite invariant speed c* = 1/\u221ak.\nPostulate 1 by itself does not tell you whether k = 0 or k > 0, nor what the value of c* is. Hence it cannot, by itself, imply that light has the same speed in all inertial frames.\n\nPostulate 2 supplies the crucial empirical input that nature is in the k > 0 case and that light propagates at the invariant speed. Equivalently, one can replace postulate 2 by a weaker statement: \u201cThere exists a finite invariant speed,\u201d and then identify that speed experimentally (Maxwell\u2019s equations and measurements show that light travels at that speed). But without such an additional assumption, postulate 1 allows both Newtonian and Einsteinian kinematics, so the invariance of the speed of light is not deducible from the first postulate alone.\n\nAnswer: No; the second postulate is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first alone. It can be weakened to \u201cthere exists a finite invariant speed,\u201d with experiment identifying it with light.\n\nConfidence: 84%",

Thus the number of such topologies is at most the number of subsets of T, i.e. at most 2^{2^{aleph_0}}.\n\nWe now build 2^{2^{aleph_0}} pairwise distinct such topologies that have no nontrivial convergent sequences.\n\nFor a sequence a = (n_k) of distinct integers, let B_a = {t \u2208 T : \u03c7_t(n_k) \u2192 1}.

The four side faces are the planes z = 4 \u2212 4x, z = 4 + 4x, z = 4 \u2212 4y, z = 4 + 4y.\n- The base (green) contributes zero flux because at z = 0 we have F = (0, 3x^2y^3, 0) and the outward normal is \u2212k, so F\u00b7n = 0.\n- Flux through each \u201cx-face\u201d (z = 4 \u2212 4x or z = 4 + 4x):\n  Parametrize z = 4 \u2212 4x face by r(y,t) = (1 \u2212 t, (1 \u2212 t)y, 4t), y \u2208 [\u22121,1], t \u2208 [0,1]. Then r_y \u00d7 r_t = (1 \u2212 t)(4, 0, 1) (outward).\n  With F(r) = (12 t (1 \u2212 t)^5 y^2, 3 (1 \u2212 t)^5 y^3, 4t), the integrand is F\u00b7(r_y \u00d7 r_t) = 48 t (1 \u2212 t)^6 y^2 + 4t(1 \u2212 t).\n  Integrating over y and t yields flux 40/21 for that face. By 180\u00b0 rotational symmetry about the z-axis, the opposite x-face has the same flux. So the two x-faces together contribute 2\u00b7(40/21) = 80/21.\n- Flux through each \u201cy-face\u201d (z = 4 \u2212 4y or z = 4 + 4y):\n  Parametrize z = 4 \u2212 4y face by r(x,t) = ((1 \u2212 t)x, 1 \u2212 t, 4t), x \u2208 [\u22121,1], t \u2208 [0,1]. Then outward r_x \u00d7 r_t = (1 \u2212 t)(0, 4, 1).\n  With F(r) = (12 t (1 \u2212 t)^5 x^3, 3 (1 \u2212 t)^5 x^2, 4t), the integrand is F\u00b7(r_x \u00d7 r_t) = 12 (1 \u2212 t)^6 x^2 + 4t(1 \u2212 t).\n  Integrating gives flux 52/21 for that face. The opposite y-face is the same, so together 2\u00b7(52/21) = 104/21.\n- Hence the flux through the two yellow sides depends on which opposite pair is painted yellow:\n  \u2022 If the yellow sides are the pair with outward normals in the \u00b1x-directions: total flux = 80/21.\n  \u2022 If the yellow sides are the pair with outward normals in the \u00b1y-directions: total flux = 104/21.\n- As a check, the total lateral flux is 80/21 + 104/21 = 184/21, which matches \u222d_V div F dV with div F = 9x^2y^2z + 9x^2y^2 + 1 over the pyramid.\n\nAnswer: \n- 80/21 if the yellow faces are the pair z = 4 \u2212 4x and z = 4 + 4x.\n- 104/21 if the yellow faces are the pair z = 4 \u2212 4y and z = 4 + 4y.\n\nConfidence: 65%",

This choice commutes with SU(N_f\u22121) rotations of the other (N_f\u22121) light flavors.\n\nGas phase (no condensate):\n- The explicit symmetry breaking by \u03bc reduces the vector flavor symmetry SU(N_f)_V to the subgroup commuting with T:\n  G_gas = SU(N_f\u22121)_V \u00d7 U(1)_T,\n  where SU(N_f\u22121)_V acts on the light flavors, and U(1)_T is generated by T (the strangeness-like charge).\n- Generators:\n  \u2022 su(N_f\u22121) block acting on the first (N_f\u22121) flavors: T^a_(N_f\u22121) embedded as diag(T^a_(N_f\u22121), 0).  \n  \u2022 One abelian generator T = diag(\u22121/(N_f\u22121) 1_(N_f\u22121), 1).\n\nCondensed phase (kaon condensation):\n- The condensate is charged under U(1)_T and transforms as a complex (N_f\u22121)-vector under SU(N_f\u22121). A nonzero expectation value picks a direction among the light flavors; without loss of generality choose the first light flavor to condense with s. This spontaneously breaks\n  SU(N_f\u22121) \u00d7 U(1)_T \u2192 SU(N_f\u22122) \u00d7 U(1)\u2032,\n  where SU(N_f\u22122) rotates the remaining (N_f\u22122) light flavors orthogonal to the chosen one, and U(1)\u2032 is a diagonal combination of U(1)_T and the U(1) inside SU(N_f\u22121) that rotates the chosen light flavor. \n- Unbroken generators:\n  \u2022 su(N_f\u22122) embedded on flavors 2,\u2026,N_f\u22121.  \n  \u2022 One abelian Q\u2032 that keeps the condensate neutral. A convenient way to write it is Q\u2032 = T + c Y_1, where\n    Y_1 = diag(1, \u22121/(N_f\u22122) 1_(N_f\u22122), 0) (acts only on the light block),\n    and c is fixed by neutrality of the condensate, q_s(Q\u2032) \u2212 q_1(Q\u2032) = 0, giving c = N_f/(N_f\u22121). Any overall normalization is immaterial.\n\nBroken generators and Goldstone counting:\n- Number of broken generators (within the symmetry of the gas phase): \n  dim[SU(N_f\u22121) \u00d7 U(1)] \u2212 dim[SU(N_f\u22122) \u00d7 U(1)\u2032] = (N_f\u22121)^2 \u2212 (N_f\u22122)^2 = 2N_f \u2212 3.\n- However, at finite chemical potential Lorentz invariance is absent and pairs of broken generators can form one type-B Nambu\u2013Goldstone mode (with quadratic dispersion). Using the Watanabe\u2013Brauner relation n_NGB = n_BS \u2212 \u00bd rank \u03c1, one finds that the 2(N_f\u22122) broken generators from the coset SU(N_f\u22121)/[SU(N_f\u22122)\u00d7U(1)] pair up into (N_f\u22122) type-B modes, while the broken U(1) (orthogonal to U(1)\u2032) yields one type-A mode.

So n \u2208 {3, 6, 9, \u2026}.\n- Use a standard 2-group parity trick: let the dihedral group D4 (all 8 symmetries of the square) act on the set of partitions. Since D4 is a 2-group, the number of objects is congruent modulo 2 to the number fixed by the whole group. Thus P_n (mod 2) equals the number of partitions invariant under every symmetry of the square (90\u00b0 rotations and reflections).\n- If n is odd (e.g., n = 3, 9, \u2026), a 90\u00b0-invariant part must have size congruent to 1 mod 4 because 90\u00b0-orbits have sizes 1 (the center) and 4; but each part has odd size n^2/3, and only one part can contain the unique center. Hence it is impossible for all three parts to be 90\u00b0-invariant, so no partition is fixed by all D4 symmetries. Therefore P_n is even for odd n (in particular, P_3 and P_9 are even).\n- For n = 6, encode 90\u00b0-invariant subsets via orbits of 90\u00b0 rotation: these orbits naturally index a 3\u00d73 \u201corbit grid.\u201d A D4-fixed partition corresponds to partitioning this 3\u00d73 grid into three connected triples that is symmetric under transposition (since a reflection acts as transpose on the orbit grid). The only coverings of a 3\u00d73 grid by three disjoint connected triples are the three rows or the three columns, which are swapped by transpose, so none is fixed. Thus P_6 is even.\n- For n = 12, the 90\u00b0-orbit grid is 6\u00d76. One can explicitly build a D4-fixed partition: pick a 12-cell connected, transpose-symmetric region A in the 6\u00d76 grid (e.g., the 3\u00d73 corner block together with the cells (4,3), (3,4), (4,4)), and then partition the remaining cells into two connected 12-cell regions that are transposes of each other. This yields three 90\u00b0-invariant connected parts in the original 12\u00d712 grid, collectively fixed by all symmetries. Hence there is at least one D4-fixed partition, so P_12 is odd.\n- Combining, the smallest n with P_n odd is n = 12.\n\nAnswer: 12\n\nConfidence: 53%",

Therefore the largest size guaranteed to exist is \u03c94, and it is also an upper bound.\n\nAnswer: \u03c94\n\nConfidence: 86%",

Let y = {\u03be\u03bd : \u03bd < \u03c91}. Then for each fixed \u03b1, all but countably many \u03bd (namely \u03bd > \u03b1) satisfy \u03be\u03bd \u2208 x\u03b1, so y \\ x\u03b1 is countable. Thus y is an uncountable pseudointersection, contradicting the definition. Therefore no tower of length \u2264 \u03c91 exists, and \u03b4 must be at least \u03c92.\n\nUpper bound (existence for \u03b4 = \u03c92): In ZFC one can build a \u2286*-decreasing well-ordered sequence of length \u03c92 with no uncountable pseudointersection. Equivalently, in the poset ([\u03c91]^{\u03c91}, \u2286*), there is a \u2286*-increasing well-ordered chain of length \u03c92 cofinal in ([\u03c91]^{\u03c91}, \u2286*); taking complements gives the desired tower. This is the generalized tower number at \u03ba = \u03c91, and it is a standard fact that for every uncountable regular \u03ba, t(\u03ba) = \u03ba^+ in ZFC. Hence here the minimal possible length is \u03c92.\n\nAnswer: \u03c92\n\nConfidence: 63%",

Exhaustively checking the five relevant king squares that can contribute (f7, f8, f6, g6, h6), we get the following counts of legal knight placements that finish the mate:\n- WK f7: knight on f8, f6, or g5 (3 ways)\n- WK f8: knight on f6 or g5 (2 ways)\n- WK f6: impossible (0 ways)\n- WK g6: knight on e7, f6, or h6 (3 ways)\n- WK h6: knight on e7 or f6 (2 ways)\n\nTotal for Kh8 with pawn g7: 3 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 10 mates.\nBy left-right symmetry, the a8/b7 corner gives another 10.\n\nThis already yields 20 distinct legal checkmates. There are many more beyond this single family (for instance, mates where the knight gives the check and the pawn/king cover the escapes, mates on other edges/corners, etc.). A complete enumeration of all legal positions of K+N+P vs K that are checkmates requires exhaustive search; without running code here, I can\u2019t give the exact grand total. But the above concrete construction shows at least 20 such legal mates.\n\nAnswer: At least 20 (from the two pawn-check corner families alone; the true total is larger and needs full enumeration)\n\nConfidence: 70%",

By the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann/FMO rules, thermal 8\u03c0 electrocyclizations are conrotatory. There are two possible conrotatory senses (both clockwise or both counterclockwise), leading to the two stereoisomeric products (cis A and trans B).\n\nTorquoselectivity (outward vs inward rotation of substituents at the termini) often biases one sense over the other. However, here the octatetraene has opposite configurations at its termini: the 2,3-double bond is Z, while the 8,9-double bond is E. For a given conrotatory sense, a Z-terminated end prefers one direction (e.g., outward) while an E-terminated end prefers the opposite; thus any chosen conrotation sense necessarily makes one end rotate outward and the other inward. The alternative conrotation sense simply swaps which end is outward/inward. Consequently, both pathways are of comparable FMO overlap and steric demand, and no torquoselective bias exists. Therefore, the cis and trans products are formed in equal amounts.\n\nAnswer: A:B = 1:1\n\nConfidence: 60%",

In particular, this applies to your sequence (the \u201cmod-finite increasing\u201d hypothesis is not needed for the conclusion under PFA). See Todorcevic, Walks on Ordinals and their Characteristics, and related results on the boundedness of colorings f: [\u03c91]^2 \u2192 \u03c91 under PFA/BPFA.\n\n- Consistency of a negative answer: In the constructible universe L (or under GCH plus square at \u03c91), one can build \u03c92-long \u2264^*-increasing sequences in (\u03c91)^{\u03c91} with the property that no uncountable subfamily is pointwise bounded by a single g. This can be obtained from standard square/diamond-guided constructions (bad scales/strong colorings) ensuring that for every uncountable X \u2286 \u03c92 there is a coordinate \u03b3 < \u03c91 at which {f_\u03b2(\u03b3): \u03b2 \u2208 X} is cofinal in \u03c91. Thus no g bounds X pointwise. References include Shelah\u2019s work on strong colorings and bad scales under \u25a1 (e.g., Shelah, Cardinal Arithmetic; see also Todorcevic, Walks on Ordinals, for constructions from \u25a1 producing such \u201cnowhere bounded\u201d behavior).\n\nTherefore, from ZFC and just the assumption that you have an \u03c92-long chain increasing modulo finite, one cannot conclude the existence of an uncountable subset that is pointwise bounded by a single function.\n\nAnswer: No; the statement is independent of ZFC (consistent both ways with additional axioms).\n\nConfidence: 65%",

Using Fourier analysis, its (even) integral satisfies\nI_n = \u222b_0^\u221e f_n(x) dx = \u03c0 \u00b7 p_n(0),\nwhere p_n is the pdf at 0 of S_n = \u2211_{k=1}^n U_k with independent U_k ~ Uniform(-1/k, 1/k). Thus I_n equals \u03c0 times the value at 0 of the n-fold convolution of these uniform densities.\n\nTwo key facts:\n- Convolution with a probability density is an averaging operator, so the L\u221e norm is nonincreasing: p_{n+1}(0) = (p_n * u_{n+1})(0) \u2264 sup_t p_n(t) = p_n(0). Hence {I_n} is monotonically nonincreasing and I_n \u2264 I_1 = \u03c0/2. Consequently, if P(n) fails, then I_n < \u03c0/2, and once it fails it can never recover (all larger k also fail).\n- For small n there is a central flat \u201cplateau\u201d of height 1/2 in the convolution density. As long as the averaging window (width 2/k) fits entirely inside the existing plateau, the value at 0 remains 1/2 and thus I_n = \u03c0/2. This happens for n = 1, 2, 3, 4. At n = 5 the averaging window first exceeds the plateau and the value drops slightly below 1/2; the difference is extremely small (well below 10^-5).\n\nFrom these, we obtain:\n- A) True: P(n) holds for 1 \u2264 n \u2264 4 (by the plateau argument).\n- B) False: It fails starting at n = 5.\n- C) True: When P(n) is false, I_n < \u03c0/2 (since the sequence is nonincreasing and starts at \u03c0/2).\n- D) True: The first failure is n = 5.\n- E) False: The limit is not \u03c0/4 (and in any case I_n \u2264 \u03c0/2 for all n).\n- F) True: The drop at n = 5 is tiny; |I_5 \u2212 \u03c0/2| < 10^-5.\n- G) True: {I_n} is monotonically nonincreasing by the L\u221e-contraction under convolution.\n- H) False: No basis to assert irrationality; this is unproven and generally not known.\n- I) False (as stated): Naive numerical evaluation typically cannot rigorously disprove equality at n = 5 due to extreme closeness; a proper analytic/rigorous error-bound argument is used in the standard proof.\n- J) False: Even for n = 1 the integrand changes sign (sin x/x oscillates).\n- K) True: Once below \u03c0/2, further convolution can only keep it the same or decrease it; thus all larger k are also false.\n- L) False: The first four equalities have a structural (Fourier/convolution) reason; it\u2019s not a coincidence.\n\nAnswer: A, C, D, F, G, K\n\nConfidence: 76%",

This yields C2 with a zero adjoined (1 case).\n\n3) Exactly one unit (only e).

Hence, if we fix n and a triple (a,b,c)\u2208D^3, the contribution \u201cturn on g_n only when (A_n,A_{n+1},A_{n+2})=(a,b,c)\u201d gives a basic building block. Since n ranges over N and there are finitely many triples per n, the family of such building blocks is countable, so the linear span of all digitary functions is at most countably dimensional.\n\nTo see the dimension is not finite, note we can build nonzero digitary functions that depend only on finitely many initial digits (e.g., only on A_0 and A_1), and we can do this at arbitrarily large positions. Concretely, for any fixed k we can choose g_0, \u2026, g_k (and set all other g_n=0) so that the sum \u2211_{n=0}^k g_n(A_n,A_{n+1},A_{n+2}) depends only on the first k+1 digits and is adjusted to be equal on the two decimal representations of any terminating decimal (this imposes only finitely many linear constraints, which can be satisfied because we have finitely many but sufficiently many parameters in the g_n\u2019s). Doing this for k=0,1,2,\u2026 yields an infinite sequence of digitary functions that are linearly independent (each new function can be chosen to depend in a new way on the (k+1)-st digit while agreeing on earlier ones). Therefore the space is infinite but, as shown above, at most countable.\n\nThus, the vector space of digitary functions has countably infinite dimension.\n\nAnswer: N\nConfidence: 66%",

Let G=G(n;p,q) be the graph on vertices {1,\u2026,n} with edges between i and j when |i\u2212j|\u2208{p,q}. The permutations obtainable from any given permutation are exactly the subgroup of S_n generated by these edge-transpositions. A standard fact is that transpositions along the edges of a graph generate the full symmetric group on its vertex set if and only if the graph is connected. Hence (p,q) is good \u21d4 G(n;p,q) is connected.\n\nAssuming gcd(p,q)=1, the graph G(n;p,q) is connected if and only if p+q\u2264n+1 (equivalently n\u2265p+q\u22121).\n\n- Necessity: If n\u2264p+q\u22122, there is no index i for which both i+q and i\u2212p lie in {1,\u2026,n}. In particular one cannot perform the basic \u201ctwo-step\u201d composites (+q then \u2212p, or +p then \u2212q) that mix the p-chains and q-chains through the interior, and one can check (e.g., by inspecting small cases such as (p,q)=(2,5), n=5; (3,5), n=6) that G(n;p,q) breaks into at least two components. More generally, one can formalize this by showing a parity-type invariant on components when n\u2264p+q\u22122.\n\n- Sufficiency: If n\u2265p+q\u22121 and gcd(p,q)=1, then from any vertex i with i\u2264n\u2212q one can go to i+q and then down by p to i+q\u2212p; similarly near the bottom one can go down by q then up by p. These composite moves realize steps of size |q\u2212p| inside the interval, and because gcd(p,q)=1, one can combine them to move between all residues. A simple chaining argument shows every vertex can reach every other, so G is connected.\n\nTherefore, for coprime 1<p,q\u2264n:\n(p,q) is a good pair \u21d4 p+q\u2264n+1.\n\nFor the probability Pr(n), if we choose (p,q) uniformly from {1,\u2026,n}\u00d7{1,\u2026,n}, the event \u201c(p,q) is good and p,q>1 and coprime\u201d is asymptotically the set\n{(p,q): p,q\u22652, gcd(p,q)=1, p+q\u2264n+1}.\nScaling by n, the region p+q\u2264n+1 has asymptotic area 1/2 of the unit square, and coprimality has natural density 6/\u03c0^2 (uniformly in such regions). The exclusion of p=1 or q=1 is negligible in the limit. Hence\nlim_{n\u2192\u221e} Pr(n) = (area factor)\u00d7(coprime density) = (1/2)\u00d7(6/\u03c0^2) = 3/\u03c0^2.\n\n(If instead one conditions on p,q being coprime and >1, the limiting conditional probability that (p,q) is good is 1/2.)\n\nAnswer: Necessary and sufficient: with 1<p,q\u2264n and gcd(p,q)=1, (p,q) is good if and only if p+q\u2264n+1.

Therefore |max({\u03bb, \u03bc}) \\ \u03bb| \u2264 2^\u03ba.\n- This bound is optimal: whenever \u03bc > \u03bb, the set-theoretic difference max({\u03bb, \u03bc}) \\ \u03bb has cardinality equal to max({\u03bb, \u03bc}). Since \u03bc can be taken as 2^\u03ba by the construction above, the maximum possible value of |max({\u03bb, \u03bc}) \\ \u03bb| is 2^\u03ba.\n\nAnswer: 2^\u03ba\n\nConfidence: 63%",

If a family F agrees with every g on \u03ba^+ many coordinates, then in particular it has f(\u03b1) \u2265 g(\u03b1) on those same \u03ba^+ many coordinates, so the \u201c\u2265\u201d-requirement is weaker.\n\n2) Lower bound: \u03bb, \u03bc \u2265 \u03ba^{++}. If |F| \u2264 \u03ba^+, enumerate F = {f_\u03be : \u03be < \u03ba^+}. Define g(\u03b1) = sup{f_\u03be(\u03b1) + 1 : \u03be < \u03b1}. Since cf(\u03ba^+) = \u03ba^+, the supremum is < \u03ba^+. Then for each \u03be, for all sufficiently large \u03b1 (indeed for all \u03b1 > \u03be), we have g(\u03b1) > f_\u03be(\u03b1). Hence for every \u03be, the set {\u03b1 : f_\u03be(\u03b1) \u2265 g(\u03b1)} is bounded (thus of size < \u03ba^+), so no such F witnesses \u03bc. A fortiori no such F witnesses \u03bb. Hence \u03bb, \u03bc \u2265 \u03ba^{++}.\n\n3) Upper bound: \u03bb, \u03bc \u2264 \u03ba^{++}. Partition \u03ba^+ into \u03ba^+ many pieces each of size \u03ba, say \u03ba^+ = \u2294_{\u03be<\u03ba^+} A_\u03be with |A_\u03be| = \u03ba. Fix, for each \u03be, an enumeration of \u03ba^{A_\u03be} of length \u03ba^{++}. Using these enumerations, one can build a family F of size \u03ba^{++} of functions on \u03ba^+ that, block by block (on each A_\u03be), ranges over the chosen \u03ba^{++} many local patterns. For any given g, choose on each block A_\u03be one local pattern that either equals g at some point of A_\u03be (to witness \u03bb) or is \u2265 g at some point of A_\u03be (to witness \u03bc); then combine these choices into a single f \u2208 F. Since there are \u03ba^+ many blocks and we guarantee at least one agreement (resp. domination) on each block, we obtain \u03ba^+ many coordinates where f and g agree (resp. where f \u2265 g). This gives \u03bb, \u03bc \u2264 \u03ba^{++}.\n\nCombining (2) and (3) yields \u03bb = \u03bc = \u03ba^{++} in ZFC.

The multivariate resultant Res(fA,fB,fC,fD) in the coefficients of these quadrics vanishes exactly in this situation. Using the standard Macaulay construction for 4 quadrics in 4 variables, one obtains a square matrix of size n equal to the number of degree-4 monomials in 4 variables, namely n = C(4+4\u22121,4\u22121) = C(7,3) = 35, whose determinant equals the resultant up to a nonzero scalar. The entries of this Macaulay matrix are linear forms in the coefficients of the fP, and those coefficients are quadratic polynomials in the coordinates of A,B,C,D,X. Hence we get a polynomial matrix map F of degree m=2 with det F(A,B,C,D,X)=0 \u21d4 (A,B,C,D,X)\u2208S.\n\nMinimality: One cannot achieve m=1. Indeed, if the entries of F were linear, det F would be a polynomial whose dependence on the data is at most linear in each coordinate, whereas the conical condition intrinsically involves squared dot products and norms; for generic fixed B,C,D,X the locus of A satisfying the cone condition is defined by a non-linear (in fact, quartic after elimination) equation, so a linear determinantal representation is impossible. For m=2, the Macaulay degree parameter t must be 4, so any such square resultant matrix has size at least the dimension of the space of degree-4 forms in 4 variables, which is 35; this bound is achieved by the standard Macaulay matrix above.\n\nTherefore the minimum of 1000 m + n is 1000\u00b72 + 35 = 2035.\n\nAnswer: 2035\nConfidence: 0.64",

Consider selecting k distinct Fibonacci numbers (with the special allowance that the value 1 may appear twice, i.e., F1 and F2 can both be used), and ask when their sum is exactly a Fibonacci number.\n\nKey observations:\n- If a set of Fibonacci indices contains no consecutive indices, then its sum is already in Zeckendorf form (the canonical sum with no consecutive indices). The only Fibonacci number with such a form having a single term is itself. Since we require at least 3 terms, any valid set must include at least one pair of consecutive indices.\n- Moreover, to reduce k terms to a single Fibonacci via identities F_i + F_{i+1} = F_{i+2}, the smallest two indices must be consecutive (otherwise the smallest one can never be merged). Merging them yields a new smallest index, and the same reasoning applies inductively.\n- This forces a unique pattern (up to a starting index i) for k terms:\n  {F_i, F_{i+1}, F_{i+3}, F_{i+5}, \u2026, F_{i+(2k-3)}}\n  That set always collapses by consecutive merges to the single number F_{i+2k-2}. For i=1, the set uses both 1\u2019s (F1 and F2), which is allowed.\n\nCounting:\n- For fixed k, the largest allowed summand index is 40, so i+(2k\u22123) \u2264 40, i.e., i \u2264 40\u2212(2k\u22123).

Fix once and for all the closed type\n   T := \u22a5 \u22b8 \u22a5.\n   T is derivable (there is a closed proof), so we can freely form tensors T \u2297 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2297 T without introducing atoms.\n\n2) Arity-indexed demand types.

Map each w \u2208 \u2115 to\n   f(w) := P(w) = T^w \u22b8 T.\n\n4) Encoding m bins of capacity b. The goal C(W,m,b) requires meeting m independent demands, each asking for exactly b tokens T to be assembled linearly into one T. We package the m demands as a tensor on the left of a final implication:\n   C(W, m, b) := (P(b) \u2297 P(b) \u2297 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2297 P(b)) \u22b8 T\n                  with m copies of P(b) in the tensor.\n   So the target sequent {f(w) | w \u2208 W} \u22a2 C is, by \u22b8-R, equivalent to\n   {f(w) | w \u2208 W}, P(b), \u2026, P(b) \u22a2 T\n   (m copies of P(b) on the left).\n\nWhy this encodes equipartition:\n- Using a left implication A \u22b8 B requires (by \u22b8-L) a subderivation of A on the right in one branch, and then B becomes available on the left in the other branch. Here A will be a tensor T^k and B will be a T. Crucially, to build T^k on the right we must use \u2297-R, which splits the context and forces us to provide exactly k copies of T on the right, each coming from some other left implication whose consequent is T. In our setup, the only sources of T are the consequents of the P(w) = T^w \u22b8 T resources (the f(w)\u2019s) or the consequents of other P(\u00b7) we are currently discharging. Thus, every time we use a P(b), we are forced to gather exactly b many T\u2019s on the right, which themselves must be produced by consuming a multiset of f(w)\u2019s whose arities sum to b (because each f(w) contributes T provided we simultaneously discharge its antecedent T^w, which again via \u2297-R forces exactly w \u201cslots\u201d to be filled, and so on). Linearity prevents sharing: each f(w) can be used at most once, and its w \u201cslots\u201d cannot be split across different uses of P(b) except by the explicit \u2297-R splitting that exactly tracks sums. The m copies of P(b) in the left tensor must all be discharged (no weakening), and the tensor rule \u2297-L lets us pick an order but not avoid using all of them. Hence, the proof exists iff the multiset {f(w) | w \u2208 W} can be split into m disjoint submultisets W1,\u2026,Wm such that in each submultiset the arities add up to b, i.e., \u2211w\u2208Wi w = b for all i.\n\n- If EP(W,m,b) holds, we construct a proof by grouping the f(w) for each Wi to build T^b on the right (using \u2297-R and the f(w)\u2019s to supply exactly b tokens T), apply P(b) by \u22b8-L to get a T on the left, and repeat for each of the m copies, then finally return T on the right. Conversely, any cut-free proof normalizes to such a grouping, yielding an equipartition.\n\nEverything used stays within the allowed fragment: only \u2297, \u22b8, and the units 1 (as T^0) and \u22a5 (inside T = \u22a5 \u22b8 \u22a5); no literals are introduced.\n\nAnswer: Choose T := (\u22a5 \u22b8 \u22a5). For n \u2265 0, let T^n denote the n-fold tensor (with T^0 := 1), and define P(n) := (T^n \u22b8 T).\n- f(w) := P(w) = (T^w \u22b8 T).\n- C(W, m, b) := (P(b) \u2297 P(b) \u2297 \u2026 \u2297 P(b)) \u22b8 T (m copies of P(b)).\n\nThen the sequent { f(w) | w \u2208 W } \u22a2 C(W,m,b) is derivable in linear logic if and only if EP(W,m,b) holds.\n\nConfidence: 62%",

To maximize coverage of black squares, place a unicorn on a white square; from such a square it attacks black squares at odd step distances along its four body-diagonal lines. The best-case position yields line lengths of 8 and 7,7,7 (inclusive), giving 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13 black squares attacked by a single unicorn.

Hence s \u2264 2.\n\n2) If s = 2: We claim the only possibility is A = {2}. Suppose A contains 2 and another element.\n- No odd element can be in A: if o \u2265 3 is the smallest odd in A, then 2 + o (odd) would have to equal a product of two odd elements \u2265 o, hence \u2265 o^2, but 2 + o < o^2, a contradiction.\n- Thus all elements of A are even. If some a \u2261 0 mod 4 is in A, then 2 + a \u2261 2 mod 4 cannot be expressed as a product of two even numbers (which are \u2261 0 mod 4), contradiction. Hence all elements are \u2261 2 mod 4.\n- Inductively, assume all elements are \u2261 2 mod 2^k (k \u2265 2). Then any product of two elements is \u2261 4 mod 2^{k+1}. Therefore every sum x + y (which must be a product) must be \u2261 4 mod 2^{k+1}. Writing x = 2 + 2^k r, y = 2 + 2^k s, this requires r + s even for all x,y \u2208 A, so all r have the same parity. Since 2 \u2208 A gives r = 0 (even), all elements are \u2261 2 mod 2^{k+1}. By induction, all elements are \u2261 2 mod 2^k for every k, forcing every element to be 2. Hence A = {2}, which is excluded.\n\n3) If s = 1: From 1 + 1 = 2 \u2208 A + A \u2286 A \u00d7 A, it follows that 2 \u2208 A. But then, as shown above, any finite A containing 2 must be {2}, which is excluded. Hence s \u2260 1.\n\nCombining the cases, there is no admissible finite A other than the excluded {2}.

Using the king\u2019s free 8 as well, any multiset of white material whose summed maxima plus 8 is less than 63 can never cover all 63 required squares.\n\n- With 13 points of material, the strongest possible combination for coverage is 4 bishops + 1 pawn: 4\u00d713 + 2 + 8(king) = 52 + 2 + 8 = 62 < 63. Therefore 13 points cannot suffice (and neither can any other 13-point mix, since bishops are the most attack-efficient per point).\n- With 14 points, one feasible mix is 4 bishops + 2 pawns: 4\u00d713 + 2\u00d72 + 8(king) = 52 + 4 + 8 = 64 \u2265 63. Thus 14 points clears the necessary attack-capacity threshold. Moreover, a concrete, legal construction exists (via two underpromotions to bishops plus two pawns) with the black king on a corner square (e.g., a1) so that a1 is the only unattacked square and all three adjacent squares (a2, b1, b2) are attacked, yielding stalemate. Hence 14 points is achievable.\n\nSince 13 is impossible by capacity and 14 is achievable by construction, the minimum is 14.\n\nAnswer: 14\n\nConfidence: 58%",

The key fact is that the P-positions (positions where the next player to move loses with perfect play) are exactly the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nSketch of why:\n- If T is not a Fibonacci number, let F be the largest Fibonacci number < T. The first player can remove T\u2212F tokens (which is < T, so legal), leaving exactly F. From then on, after each opponent move of size x, the first player can respond with a move y so that x+y is the next Fibonacci number (this is always possible because F_{i+1} \u2264 2F_i, so the \u201ccompletion\u201d y is within the allowed \u2264 2x). This keeps the pile on Fibonacci numbers after the first player\u2019s turns and ensures the first player eventually takes the last token.\n- Conversely, if T is a Fibonacci number, the above pairing strategy is available to the second player: whatever the first player takes, the second \u201ccompletes\u201d to the next Fibonacci number, thereby returning the pile to a Fibonacci size after the second player\u2019s turns. Hence the first player cannot force a win.\n\nTherefore, the second player has a winning strategy exactly when the initial pile size T is a Fibonacci number.\n\nAnswer: Exactly those T that are Fibonacci numbers: T \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \u2026}.\n\nConfidence: 85%",

            "response": "Explanation: \n- Let \u03b1 = \u2220CAB and let D correspond to an arc offset t from A on the circumcircle (so 0 < t < \u03b1). Put the circumcircle radius as R. \n- Use Menelaus in triangle ACB with transversal E\u2013F\u2013G and AF = FC to get BG/GA = EB/EC. For AD meeting the circumcircle again at D, the equal-angle fact in the cyclic quadrilateral gives BE/CE = BD/CD. Hence AG:GB = CD:BD. \n- Power of a point at G with respect to the circumcircle: GD \u00b7 GI = GA \u00b7 GB. Given DG = 3, GH = 5, HI = 1, the order along line DG is D\u2013G\u2013H\u2013I, so DI = 9 and GI = 6; thus GA \u00b7 GB = 3 \u00b7 6 = 18. Using AG:GB = CD:BD with chord lengths BD = 2R sin((\u03b1 \u2212 t)/2), CD = 2R sin((\u03b1 + t)/2), AB = 2R sin(\u03b1/2), one gets GA \u00b7 GB = R^2 (cos t \u2212 cos \u03b1)/(2 cos^2(t/2)) = 18. This later yields R^2 = 18\u00b7(1+u^2)/(u^2\u2212v^2) when using half-angle variables u = tan(\u03b1/2), v = tan(t/2).\n- Parametrize the line DG by X(\u03bb) = D + \u03bb(G \u2212 D), with \u03bb = 0 at D and \u03bb = 1 at G. A direct (but clean) trig computation shows:\n  \u2022 \u03bb_H = sin t/(sin \u03b1 \u2212 sin t). Given GH/DG = 5/3, we have \u03bb_H = 1 + 5/3 = 8/3, hence sin t = (8/11) sin \u03b1.\n  \u2022 \u03bb_I = 2a/(a \u2212 b\u00b7(X/Y)) = 2 sin(\u03b1/2)/(sin(\u03b1/2) \u2212 cos(\u03b1/2) tan(t/2)). Since DI/DG = 9/3 = 3, this yields tan(t/2) = (1/3) tan(\u03b1/2).\n- Let u = tan(\u03b1/2). Then v = tan(t/2) = u/3, and the relation sin t = (8/11) sin \u03b1 becomes (with half-angle formulas) 3u/(9+u^2) = 8u/(11(1+u^2)), giving u^2 = 39/25.\n- From the power equation above, R^2 = 18\u00b7(1+u^2)/(u^2\u2212v^2). With v = u/3 this gives R^2 = (81/4)\u00b7(1+u^2)/u^2 = 432/13.\n- Compute AE. From similar triangles along AD (or coordinates), AE = (1 \u2212 cos \u03b1)/(1 \u2212 cos t) \u00b7 AD, and AD = 2R\u221a(1 \u2212 cos t), hence AE = 2R(1 \u2212 cos \u03b1)/\u221a(1 \u2212 cos t). Using half-angle identities, 1 \u2212 cos \u03b1 = 2u^2/(1+u^2) and 1 \u2212 cos t = 2v^2/(1+v^2). Substituting u^2 = 39/25 and v = u/3 plus R^2 = 432/13 simplifies to AE = (9\u221a33)/2.\n- Therefore AE = (9\u221a33)/2, so a + b + c = 9 + 33 + 2 = 44.\n\nAnswer: 44\n\nConfidence: 92%",

A set of queens is non-attacking iff no two share the same row, column, or either toroidal diagonal, i.e., their row r, column c, difference d = r \u2212 c (mod 5), and sum s = r + c (mod 5) values are all distinct.\n\nKey bijection: Any placement of 4 non-attacking queens uniquely extends to a placement of 5 non-attacking queens by putting the 5th queen in the unique missing row and column. Its d and s automatically equal the missing difference and sum (since in Z5 the missing value equals the negative sum of the used ones), so the extension is valid. Conversely, removing any queen from a 5-queen solution yields a valid 4-queen placement. Hence:\n#(4-queen placements) = 5 \u00d7 #(5-queen placements).\n\nSo we just need the number of 5-queen solutions. Writing a 5-queen solution as a permutation r = \u03c0(c), the non-attacking condition is that both \u03c0(c) \u2212 c and \u03c0(c) + c are permutations of Z5. Consider consecutive columns c, c+1, \u2026 and set s_c = \u03c0(c+1) \u2212 \u03c0(c). Then for all c, s_c \u2208 {2,3} (slopes cannot be 0, \u00b11). But for any c, the slope between c and c+2 is (s_c + s_{c+1})/2 and must also be in {2,3}. Since 2+3 \u2261 0 (mod 5), this forces s_c = s_{c+1} for all c, so all s_c are equal and \u03c0 is affine linear: \u03c0(c) = a c + b with a \u2208 {2,3} and b \u2208 Z5. These are exactly the 5-queen toroidal solutions, giving 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 solutions.\n\nTherefore, #(4-queen placements) = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nAnswer: 50\nConfidence: 86%",

Moreover, f(v) = \u21131(v1)\u00b7\u21132(v2) mixes \u201cv1\u201d and \u201cv2\u201d ambiguously (seemingly referring to different subvectors or coordinates), so it is not a proper n-dimensional density.\n- The matrix M(a,b) is not symmetric under the given definition (off-diagonals depend on b^i rather than symmetrically on i and j), so a Cholesky factorization generally does not exist.\n- The returned matrix X = Q diag(e^v) Q^T S is not symmetric in general, so it does not lie in SPD, whereas the Rao\u2013Fisher volume measure is on SPD. Hence the induced density p_{a,b} on SPD cannot be evaluated at non-symmetric arguments.\n\nIndependently, the query evaluates p_{a,b} at X1(a,c) and X2(a,d), where [X1]_{ij} = c^i a^{|i-j|} and [X2]_{ij} = d^i a^{|i-j|}. For generic c,d \u2265 1 these matrices are not symmetric unless c = 1 or d = 1, so they are not SPD, and the density on SPD is zero or undefined at these points.

Using the QR- and Cholesky-steps, X = Q diag(e^v) Q^T S, where M = S S^T, so det(X) = det(S) exp(\u2211 v_i) and det(M) = det(S)^2. Hence z = exp(-2k \u2211_{i=1}^n v_i).\n- Thus the law of z is determined entirely by S := \u2211 v_i.\n- The joint density f(v) = \u21131(v) \u21132(v) has \u21131(v) \u221d exp(-||v||^2/(2\u03c3^2)) and \u21132 depending only on pairwise differences v_i \u2212 v_j (up to the minor j\u2265i typo; it should be i<j). Therefore f(v) factorizes in mean-plus-differences coordinates: if m = (1/n)\u2211 v_i and w = v \u2212 m 1 with \u2211 w_i = 0, then f(v) \u221d exp(-n m^2/(2\u03c3^2)) \u00d7 G(w), so the marginal of m is exactly Gaussian N(0, \u03c3^2/n), and hence S = \u2211 v_i = n m \u223c N(0, n \u03c3^2). In our call, \u03c3 = 1 and n = 1021, so S \u223c N(0, n).\n- Consequently, ln Z = ln z = -2k S \u223c N(0, (2k)^2 n). So z is lognormal with parameters \u03bc = 0 and \u03c4^2 = (2k)^2 n.\n- For a lognormal with ln Z \u223c N(\u03bc, \u03c4^2), the density is p(z) = [1/(z \u03c4 \u221a(2\u03c0))] exp(-(ln z \u2212 \u03bc)^2/(2 \u03c4^2)), and the differential entropy (in nats) is d = \u03bc + \u00bd ln(2\u03c0 e \u03c4^2).\n- Plugging \u03bc = 0 and \u03c4 = 2k \u221an gives:\n  \u2022 p_k(1) = 1/(2k \u221a(2\u03c0 n));\n  \u2022 d_k = \u00bd ln(2\u03c0 e (2k)^2 n) = ln(2k) + \u00bd ln(2\u03c0 e n).\n- Therefore \u2113(k) = p_k(1) + 2 d_k \u2212 1 = 1/(2k \u221a(2\u03c0 n)) + ln(8 \u03c0 e n k^2) \u2212 1.

They match the usual cycle index/Burnside setup for pairs of cycles and are consistent with the decomposition by divisors and automorphism orders, so both are true.\n\n- For (c), set N=8, h=4. Model the dessin by two 8-cycles \u03b1 (around the white vertex) and \u03b2 (around the black vertex) on {1,\u2026,8}, up to simultaneous conjugation. Fix \u03b1 as the standard 8-cycle. Faces correspond to cycles of f = \u03b1\u03b2; a degree-2 face corresponds to a fixed point of f. Thus we need f of cycle type 1^4 2^2 (4 fixed points and two 2-cycles).\n\nCounting \u03b2 with \u03b1 fixed and f of type 1^4 2^2 can be done via the class algebra/character formula. Using that for an 8-cycle only hook representations contribute and that \u03c7^(n\u2212k,1^k)(8-cycle) = (\u22121)^k, one obtains that the number of \u03b2 (8-cycles) such that \u03b1\u03b2 has type 1^4 2^2 is 70.\n\nMoreover, from f^2 = e one deduces \u03b2^2 centralizes \u03b1, hence \u03b2^2 \u2208 \u27e8\u03b1\u27e9 and in fact \u03b2^2 = \u03b1^\u00b12. Therefore every such \u03b2 commutes with \u03b1^2 (and \u03b1^4). Thus the stabilizer of \u03b2 under conjugation by the centralizer \u27e8\u03b1\u27e9 has size 4, so each \u27e8\u03b1\u27e9-orbit has size 2.

So the actual circle has no run of three equal colors (no BBB and no WWW anywhere). Every monochrome run has length at most 2.\n\n- From the second \u201cNo\u201d: If the circle had two separate adjacent equal-color pairs at distance one apart (e.g., \u2026 BB W BB \u2026 or \u2026 WW B WW \u2026), then the person sitting between those pairs would, after learning there are no runs of three, be able to fix the colors of both of their (unseen) neighbors, and hence determine their own hat in the second round. Since everyone still said \u201cNo\u201d the second time, that situation cannot occur. With 9 seats and totals 5 black/4 white and no runs of three, there must be at least one adjacent equal pair, and the only way to avoid the second-round deduction above is that there is exactly one such pair, and it must be of the majority color (black). All the remaining hats must then alternate around the circle. Up to rotation/reflection, the circle is:\n  B W B W B W B W B\n  (i.e., alternating, with a single adjacent BB pair).\n\n- Why the third \u201cYes\u201d: Consider either member of the unique adjacent BB pair. After two universal \u201cNo\u201d answers, each of them reasons: \u201cIf my hat were white, then my two neighbors would both have to be black (to keep the counts right and avoid runs of three), which would create two adjacent BB pairs separated by one seat. That would have let someone deduce in the second round\u2014contrary to fact. Therefore my hat cannot be white; it must be black.\u201d Both members of the BB pair can make this reasoning and answer \u201cYes\u201d on the third question. \n- No one else can be certain at that moment: each of the other players still has two symmetric possibilities for their unseen triple consistent with the first two \u201cNo\u201ds (one making them black, the other white), so they must still say \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThus exactly the two people wearing the adjacent black hats know their colors at the third question, and the only arrangement consistent with the dialogue is an alternating circle with exactly one adjacent BB pair.\n\nAnswer: 2 people say \u201cYes.\u201d The hats are arranged alternatingly around the table with exactly one adjacent pair of blacks (e.g., B W B W B W B W B, up to rotation/reflection).\n\nConfidence: 75%",

The zero-sum condition can be handled via a carry chain c_i with r_i = 3c_{i-1} - c_i and |r_i| \u2264 3.

The procedure samples X \u2208 Sym(n) as a centered Gaussian in the \u201cvech with \u221a2 off-diagonal\u201d coordinates, then returns Y = Exp(X). Thus the density on SPD(n) is p(Y) = p_X(Log Y) \u00b7 |J_Log(Y)|, where J_Log is the Jacobian of the matrix logarithm.\n\n- For U(a) = I + a^2 J (J = 11^T), its eigenvalues are \u03bb1 = 1 + n a^2 (mult. 1) and \u03bb2 = 1 (mult. n\u22121). Hence Log(U(a)) has eigenvalues log(1 + n a^2) and 0. Using the standard formula for the differential of the matrix log, the Jacobian determinant at U(a) is\n  log |J_Log(U(a))| = \u2212log(1 + n a^2) + (n\u22121) log( log(1 + n a^2) / (n a^2) ).\n  Differentiating w.r.t. a gives the Jacobian contribution to the score\n  \u2113_J(a) = \u2212 (2 n a)/(1 + n a^2) + (n\u22121) [ (2 n a)/((1 + n a^2) log(1 + n a^2)) \u2212 2/a ].\n\n- The Gaussian term contributes \u2212x'(a)^T \u03a3^{-1} x(a) where x(a) = c(a) v with c(a) = log(1 + n a^2)/n and v fixed. Thus this term equals \u2212c(a)c'(a) v^T \u03a3^{-1} v with c'(a) = 2a/(1 + n a^2). For n = 10^9, c(a)c'(a) = O(log(n)/(n^2 a)), so this Gaussian score is O(log n) in magnitude (i.e., on the order of tens to hundreds), whereas the Jacobian term scales like O(n) (tens of millions to billions). Therefore, for the floor of the sum over 10 primes, the Gaussian term is negligible and does not affect the integer part.\n\n- Using n = 10^9 and primes a \u2208 {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29}, we evaluate the dominant Jacobian part:\n  \u2113(a) \u2248 \u2212 (2 n a)/(1 + n a^2) + (n\u22121) [ (2 n a)/((1 + n a^2) ln(1 + n a^2)) \u2212 2/a ].\n  With n a^2 \u226b 1, this simplifies numerically to\n  \u2113(a) \u2248 \u22122n/a + (n\u22121)\u00b72/(a ln(1 + n a^2)) \u2212 2/a.\n  Summing over the 10 primes,\n  \u03a3 1/p = 1.533438771872,\n  \u03a3 2/(p ln(1 + n p^2)) \u2248 0.1298563.\n  Hence\n  \u03a3 \u2113(a) \u2248 \u22122n \u03a3(1/p) + (n\u22121) \u03a3 2/(p ln(1 + n p^2)) \u2212 2 \u03a3(1/p)\n           \u2248 \u22123,066,877,543.744 + 129,856,299.870 \u2212 3.066877544\n           \u2248 \u22122,937,021,243.874 (Gaussian term omitted as negligible).\n  Taking the floor gives \u22122,937,021,244.\n\nAnswer: -2937021244\n\nConfidence: 62%",

Consequently, the tangent space at M is T_M = {U \u2208 SYM(n) : U\u00b71_n = 0}.\n- With M_ij = 1/n, the Riemannian metric becomes a scaled Frobenius inner product, so the orthogonal projection onto T_M is the Frobenius projection. For any symmetric Y, the projection is characterized by tr(Proj_M(Y)) = tr(Y) \u2212 (u^T Y u)/||u||^2.

This yields:\n- n \u2261 0,1 (mod 3): maximum = \u230an/3\u230b,\n- n \u2261 2 (mod 3): maximum = \u230an/3\u230b + 1.\nEquivalently, the maximum is \u230a(n+1)/3\u230b. This bound is attained by the partition into 3\u2019s and, when needed, a single 2.\n\nAnswer: \u230a(n+1)/3\u230b\n\nConfidence: 92%",

Seeking an integrating factor \u03bc so that ((2x^5+1)\u03bc y2')' + 10x^3 \u03bc y2 = 0, we need ((2x^5+1)\u03bc)'/\u03bc = 14x^4, which gives \u03bc = (2x^5+1)^{2/5}. Hence\n  ((2x^5+1)^{7/5} y2')' + 10x^3(2x^5+1)^{2/5} y2 = 0.\n  With the substitution y2 = v(2x^5+1)^{-2/5}, this reduces to (2x^5+1)v'' + 6x^4 v' \u2212 6x^3 v = 0, which admits v = x. Therefore\n  y2(x) = y2(0) + y2'(0)\u00b7[x(2x^5+1)^{-2/5}] = (1/n) x(2x^5+1)^{-2/5}.\n- Then y2(x)/x = (1/n)(2x^5+1)^{-2/5} > 0 for x > 0, so\n  (y2(x)/x)^5 = (1/n^5)(2x^5+1)^{-2} > 0.\n  Since \u22128y_d^6/(1+y_d) = \u22128/(n^6+n^5) < 0 for n \u2265 1, the inequality\n  (y2(x)/x)^5 > \u22128y_d^6/(1+y_d)\n  holds for all x > 0 regardless of n. Thus the \u201cregion\u201d specified is the entire x > 0 domain.\n- To ensure y1 and y2 do not intersect for x > 0, we need y2(x) to be below y1(x) for all x > 0. Using the given anchor values for y1 and the explicit y2, the most restrictive of the provided points is x = 10:\n  y2(10) = (1/n)\u00b710\u00b7(2\u00b710^5+1)^{-2/5} \u2248 (0.0758)/n,\n  y1(10) = 1/625 \u2248 0.0016.\n  Requiring y2(10) \u2264 y1(10) gives n \u2265 0.0758/0.0016 \u2248 47.4, so the minimal integer is n = 48. (At x = 2 and x = 6 the constraint is much looser.)\n- Because the inequality region is all x > 0, the requested integral is simply the antiderivative of y1 over x > 0. Without solving the first third-order ODE explicitly, that antiderivative cannot be simplified further from the given data. Therefore, the integral over the specified region is \u222b y1(x) dx (i.e., an antiderivative Y1(x) + C).\n\nAnswer: \n- Minimal n ensuring non-intersection: n = 48.\n- The region is all x > 0, so \u222b y1(x) dx over that region is the antiderivative Y1(x) + C (no further closed form is determined from the given data).\n\nConfidence: 0.46",

One can solve T1 explicitly (e.g., with the invariant r = (x1^2 \u2212 2)/(x1^2 + 2), which flips sign under x1 \u21a6 \u22122/x1) to obtain a concrete T1, and similarly express T2 through a pair (T2(x), T2(1\u2212x)) parametrized by q = 2x \u2212 1 with two admissible branches. In particular, for x \u2208 [0,1], the composite argument z(x) = T1(\u221a2 x) + T2(x) is a continuous function taking values in some compact interval I \u2282 \u211d (numerically, for the natural branch choice one finds z(0) = 4 and z(1) \u2248 7/3, so I \u2282 [7/3, 4], but the precise range is not needed for the conclusion below).\n- The interfacial flux function \u03a6 is only constrained locally by the two fractional derivative limits at z \u2192 4 and z \u2192 1:\n  \u2022 lim_{z\u21924} D_z^{1/2} \u03a6(z) = 5/(2\u221a\u03c0),\n  \u2022 lim_{z\u21921} {}^{C}D_z^{1/2} \u03a6(z) = 1/\u221a\u03c0.\n  These limits fix the leading local behavior of \u03a6 near z = 4 and z = 1 (e.g., they are consistent with \u03a6 containing terms (5/\u03c0)\u221a(z \u2212 4) and (2/\u03c0)\u221a(z \u2212 1) in neighborhoods of 4 and 1), but they impose no restriction on \u03a6 away from arbitrarily small neighborhoods of those two points.\n- Consequently, one can construct admissible \u03a6 by taking any fixed \u201cbase\u201d function \u03a60 that realizes the required limits at z = 1 and z = 4 (for instance, paste suitable \u221a(z \u2212 1) and \u221a(z \u2212 4) profiles near those points), and then subtract a large multiple of a smooth bump function \u03c8 supported strictly inside the image interval I but away from z = 1 and z = 4. This modification does not affect the two fractional derivative limits (the bump vanishes near z = 1 and z = 4), yet it makes \u03a6 arbitrarily negative on the range of z(x).\n- Since \u03b51(x) + \u03b52(x) = \u03a6(T1(\u221a2 x) + T2(x)) = \u03a6(z(x)), the total energy \n  E_total = \u222b_0^1 \u03a6(z(x)) dx \n  can be driven to \u2212\u221e by scaling the negative bump. Therefore, without additional global constraints on \u03a6 (such as monotonicity, convexity, positivity, or a normalization of its absolute values), the problem is underdetermined and the total energy is unbounded below.\n\nAnswer: There is no finite minimum; infimum E_total = \u2212\u221e.\n\nConfidence: 62%",

Hence z(t) = \u221a2 cos t and the analogous trajectory with z1(0) = 1 is z1(t) = cos t.\n- Using z(t) = \u221a2 cos t, the kernel in the echo equation becomes z(\u03c4 \u2212 t) z(t + \u03c4) = cos(2t) + cos(2\u03c4).

Then f satisfies the homogeneous ODE x^2 f^{(4)} + 2x f^{(3)} - f = 0 with initial data independent of n: f(0)=0, f'(0)=1, f''(0)=-1, f'''(0)=1/2. Hence f is the same for all n, and y_2(x) = f(x) - (10/n) x^2.\n- Extrema of y_2 are zeros of y_2'(x) = f'(x) - (20/n) x, i.e., intersections of the fixed curve f'(x) with the line of slope 20/n. For the two specified values n=10000 and n=-2000, the slopes are small in magnitude and opposite in sign, and the smoothness/shape of f' implies the counts are equal; thus a = \u03bb.\n- In the fractional diffusion equation for y_3, the coefficient multiplying y_{2s}'(x) is (a - \u03bb)/\u03bb^a. Since a = \u03bb, this coefficient is zero, so the Caputo equation reduces to d^{1/2} y_3/dx^{1/2} = 0 with y_3(0)=0, whose unique solution is y_3(x) \u2261 0. Therefore y_3(x_0) = 0 for any x_0.\n- Consequently, regardless of N, (N + \u03bb) [y_3(x_0)]^{\u03bb/a} = (N + \u03bb) \u00b7 0 = 0.\n\nAnswer: 0\n\nConfidence: 62%",

The term t^2/8 is spatially uniform and only changes the global phase, so it does not affect the velocity field. The linear term \u2212x/2 corresponds to a uniform force +1/2, i.e., a uniform acceleration a = +1/2. With the standard gauge choice (consistent with the given stationary density profile), the initial current is zero, so v(t) = \u222b a dt = t/2, independent of x.

Thus the differential cross-section is proportional to |(k \u00d7 k') \u00b7 B(q)|^2 / q^4. For a magnetic monopole with charge e_m = g, the field is B(r) = g r\u0302/r^2, whose Fourier transform is B_mon(q) = \u2212i 4\u03c0 g q/q^2, i.e., it is purely longitudinal (parallel to q). Since (k \u00d7 k') is perpendicular to q, (k \u00d7 k') \u00b7 B_mon(q) = 0, so the first-Born cross-section for charge\u2013monopole scattering vanishes.\n\nFor a magnetic dipole \u03bc, B_dip(q) = \u22124\u03c0[\u03bc \u2212 q(\u03bc\u00b7q)/q^2], which is purely transverse to q and generically has a nonzero projection on (k \u00d7 k'). Therefore the dipole cross-section is nonzero (except for the special case \u03bc \u2225 q). With identical momentum transfer q (hence same kinematics) the kinematic prefactors cancel in the ratio, yielding zero for the monopole relative to the dipole at this order. The provided numerical values (\u03b8, v, e_m, \u03bc) are irrelevant for this conclusion within the first Born approximation.\n\nAnswer: 0\n\nConfidence: 75%",

Please confirm the exact descriptor names/software so I match your convention.\n- Specify the homolog set to consider (e.g., aldehydes CH3\u2013(CH2)n\u2013CHO for which range of n).\n- With that settled, the computation is:\n  1) For each aldehyde homolog, compute GATSSe(i) (Geary autocorrelations weighted by Sanderson electronegativities) across all lags i.\n  2) Identify i_max as the lag at which GATSSe(i) is maximal (or identify molecules whose maximum value is in [2, 3], depending on your intended meaning).\n  3) For each such molecule, take the same order i_max and compute \u0394X(i_max) = XvPA(i_max) \u2212 XPA(i_max).\n  4) Compute P = i_max \u00d7 \u0394X(i_max).\n  5) Report the minimum P across the selected homologs.\n\nIf you can provide the GATSSe(i) and XvPA/XPA values (or allow me to compute them with a specific tool), I\u2019ll return the requested minimum product immediately.\n\nAnswer: I need clarification on the intended meaning of \u201cbetween 2 and 3\u201d (lag vs numerical value) and the exact descriptor naming/software, plus either the descriptor values or permission to compute them for the aldehyde homologs.\n\nConfidence: 15%",

            "response": "Explanation: The quantity you ask for cannot be determined from the information provided. Here is why:\n- The choice of n0 via minimizing Tr(D_n) \u00b7 (Det(D_n))^{1/n} for the LDL\u2032 (rational Cholesky) of the symmetric part of M_n does not determine M_{n0} itself, nor does it impose enough structure on its cofactor (adjugate) matrix adj(M_{n0}).\n- The target matrix is built through several non-unique operations: take the cofactor matrix C = adj(M_{n0}), then its antisymmetric part A = (C \u2212 C^T)/2, and then a Parlett\u2013Reid\u2013type tridiagonalization of A. Parlett\u2013Reid is a congruence reduction (with permutations and unit lower triangular factors), not an orthogonal similarity, so the singular values of the resulting tridiagonal factor T (and hence those of T^2) are not invariants of A; different valid Parlett\u2013Reid sequences can produce different T with different singular values.\n- Even fixing a specific Parlett\u2013Reid implementation, the singular values of T^2 (hence any Ky Fan k-norm) depend on the actual entries of M_{n0}. The condition that the eigenvalues of M_{n} lie on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set does not fix adj(M_{n0}) or its antisymmetric part.\n- If by \u201clargest Ky Fan norm\u201d you mean the Ky Fan n-norm (the nuclear norm), then for an orthogonal tridiagonalization one could relate ||T^2||_* to ||A||_F^2, but Parlett\u2013Reid does not preserve Frobenius norm, so even that surrogate is not available here.\n\nThe only universal statement we can make is: if the antisymmetric part of the cofactor matrix vanishes (i.e., adj(M_{n0}) is symmetric), then the tridiagonal factor is the zero matrix and every Ky Fan norm of its square is 0. Absent that special case or an explicit M_{n0}, the requested norm is indeterminate.\n\nAnswer: Not determined from the given information (indeterminate). It equals 0 only if adj(M_{n0}) is symmetric (i.e., its antisymmetric part is zero).\n\nConfidence: 15%",
