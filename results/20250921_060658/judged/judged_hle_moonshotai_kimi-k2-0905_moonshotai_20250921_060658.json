In particular  \n\u2003\u2003\u03c0\u2081\u2082MSpin = \u2124 \u2295 \u2124 (two free generators).  \n3.  **The classifying space BG\u2082** is 6-connected (because G\u2082 itself is 2-connected and \u03c0\u2083G\u2082 = \u2124, so the first non-trivial homotopy group of BG\u2082 is \u03c0\u2084BG\u2082 \u2245 \u2124).  Consequently the Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequence for \u03a9_*^{Spin}(BG\u2082) has its first possibly non-zero differentials starting on the 4-line, hence  \n\u2003\u2003\u03a9\u2099^{Spin}(BG\u2082) \u2245 \u03a9\u2099^{Spin}\u2003for n \u2264 5.  \n4.  **The reduced group** is by definition the kernel of the collapse map  \n\u2003\u2003\u03a9\u2099^{Spin}(BG\u2082) \u2192 \u03a9\u2099^{Spin}(*),  \nso for n \u2264 5 the reduced group vanishes.  The first potentially non-zero reduced group occurs in dimension 6, where the AHSS gives a \u2124 coming from H\u2084(BG\u2082;\u2124) \u2245 \u2124.  In dimension 12 the only contribution to the reduced bordism group comes from the same 4-dimensional cohomology class, and the AHSS collapses for degree reasons.  Hence  \n\u2003\u2003\u03a9\u0303\u2081\u2082^{Spin}(BG\u2082) \u2245 \u2124.  \n\nAnswer: \u2124  \nConfidence: 95 %",
