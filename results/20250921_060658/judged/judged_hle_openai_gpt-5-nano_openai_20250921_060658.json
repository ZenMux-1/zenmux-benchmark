The AHSS has\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG2; \u03a9_q^{Spin}) \u21d2 \u03a9^{Spin}_{p+q}(BG2).\nSince we want the reduced group, we factor out the contribution coming from maps to a point (the p = 0 line corresponds to the basepoint). For p > 0, only those p with p + q = 12 can contribute to \u03a9^{Spin}_{12}(BG2).\n\nFacts we use:\n- H^*(BG2; Z) is freely generated by invariants in degrees 4 and 12 (so H_p(BG2; Z) is nonzero only for p = 0, 4, 12 in the range up to 12, with H_4 \u2245 Z and H_12 \u2245 Z; H_8 vanishes in cohomology, hence H_8(BG2; Z) = 0).\n- Low Spin bordism groups: \u03a9_0^{Spin} \u2245 Z, \u03a9_4^{Spin} \u2245 Z, \u03a9_8^{Spin} \u2245 Z \u2295 Z, and, in particular, \u03a9_{12}^{Spin} has a Z summand plus torsion, but the p = 0 piece will be removed in the reduced theory.\n\nCompute the relevant E^2 terms in degree 12 with p > 0:\n- p = 12, q = 0: E^2_{12,0} \u2245 H_{12}(BG2; \u03a9_0^{Spin}) \u2245 H_{12}(BG2; Z) \u2245 Z.\n- p = 4, q = 8: E^2_{4,8} \u2245 H_4(BG2; \u03a9_8^{Spin}) \u2245 H_4(BG2; Z) \u2297 (Z \u2295 Z) \u2245 Z \u2295 Z.\n- p > 0 with q other than (12,0) or (4,8) do not contribute in this degree because H_p(BG2; Z) vanishes for other p in [0,12] and \u03a9_q^{Spin} for q \u2208 {2,6,10, etc.} are not involved here.\n\nThere are no nontrivial differentials hitting these p > 0 groups (the only possible incoming differentials would come from higher p with nonzero H_p(BG2; \u00b7), but odd p vanish for BG2 and H_8(BG2) = 0, so no differentials affect these groups in this range). Hence E\u221e_{12,0} \u2245 Z and E\u221e_{4,8} \u2245 Z^2.\n\nThus the part of \u03a9^{Spin}_{12}(BG2) coming from p > 0 is Z \u2295 Z \u2295 Z (rank 3). The p = 0 piece is the basepoint contribution \u03a9^{Spin}_{12}(pt), which is killed in the reduced theory. Therefore the reduced group is\n-\u0303\u03a9^{Spin}_{12}(BG2) \u2245 Z^3.\n\nAnswer: Z^3\nConfidence: 0.54",
