            "response": "Explanation:  \nWe want to compute the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\), denoted \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\). The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\nKey points and approach:\n\n1. **Background on \\(G_2\\):**  \n   \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, exceptional Lie group of dimension 14. Its classifying space \\(BG_2\\) is 3-connected (since \\(G_2\\) is 2-connected), and its cohomology ring with integer coefficients is known to be torsion-free and generated by classes in degrees 4 and 12:\n   \\[\n   H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n   \\]\n   where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are generators in degrees 4 and 12 respectively.\n\n2. **Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\):**  \n   The Spin bordism groups are known up to dimension 12:\n   \\[\n   \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}^2, \\quad \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}^3.\n   \\]\n   The generators correspond to certain manifolds with Spin structure, e.g., K3 surface in dimension 4, and products or special manifolds in higher dimensions.\n\n3. **Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS):**  \n   To compute \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\), we use the AHSS:\n   \\[\n   E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n   \\]\n   Since \\(BG_2\\) is simply connected and has no torsion in homology, and \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) is torsion-free in low degrees, the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\) with no extension problems.\n\n4. **Homology of \\(BG_2\\):**  \n   By universal coefficients and Poincar\u00e9 duality for \\(BG_2\\) (which is infinite-dimensional but behaves like a 3-connected space with polynomial cohomology), the homology groups relevant up to degree 12 are:\n   \\[\n   H_0(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}.\n   \\]\n   Other homology groups in degrees less than 12 vanish or are zero.\n\n5. **Computing \\(E^2_{p,q}\\) with \\(p+q=12\\):**  \n   The possible pairs \\((p,q)\\) with \\(p+q=12\\) and \\(q\\) in Spin bordism degrees are:\n   - \\((0,12)\\): \\(H_0(BG_2) \\otimes \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}^3 = \\mathbb{Z}^3\\)\n   - \\((4,8)\\): \\(H_4(BG_2) \\otimes \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\)\n   - \\((8,4)\\): \\(H_8(BG_2) \\otimes \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\). But \\(H_8(BG_2) = 0\\) (since no generator in degree 8).\n   - \\((12,0)\\): \\(H_{12}(BG_2) \\otimes \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n   So the \\(E^2\\)-page at total degree 12 is:\n   \\[\n   E^2_{0,12} = \\mathbb{Z}^3, \\quad E^2_{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z}^2, \\quad E^2_{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad \\text{others zero}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Differentials and extensions:**  \n   Since \\(BG_2\\) is 3-connected and the Spin bordism groups are torsion-free in these degrees, the differentials vanish and there are no extension problems. Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}^6.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\):**  \n   The reduced bordism group is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion:\n   \\[\n   \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n   \\]\n   The image corresponds to the summand \\(E^2_{0,12} = \\mathbb{Z}^3\\) (bordism classes with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle).\n\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}^3,\n   \\]\n   coming from the summands \\(E^2_{4,8}\\) and \\(E^2_{12,0}\\).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3\\).\n- \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^6\\).\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3\\).\n\nAnswer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3.\n}\n\\]\n\nConfidence: 90%  \nThis is a standard application of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence and known computations of Spin bordism and \\(BG_2\\) cohomology. The main uncertainty lies in subtle extension or differential issues, but these are very unlikely given the torsion-free nature and connectivity of \\(BG_2\\).",
