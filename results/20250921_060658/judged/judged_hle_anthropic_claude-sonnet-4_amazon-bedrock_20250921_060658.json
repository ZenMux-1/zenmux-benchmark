Lives above the critical level contribute positively to the value of a population, while lives below it contribute negatively.\n\nLet me examine each condition:\n\nA. Egalitarian Dominance: This requires that if population A has the same total well-being as population B but A has a more equal distribution, then A is better than B.\n\nB. General Non-Extreme Priority: This limits how much priority can be given to worse-off individuals.\n\nC. Non-Elitism: This prevents giving disproportionate weight to the best-off individuals.\n\nD. Weak Non-Sadism: This condition roughly states that it's not better to add lives that are barely worth living to a population of lives with very high well-being.\n\nE. Weak Quality Addition: This condition states that adding lives with sufficiently high well-being to any population makes it better.\n\nCritical-level views are known to violate Weak Quality Addition. This is because in critical-level views, adding lives that are above the critical level but below the average well-being of the existing population can actually make the population worse off (since it lowers the average while the critical level remains fixed). This directly contradicts Weak Quality Addition, which says that adding sufficiently good lives should always improve a population.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition because they can judge that adding lives with high well-being (but below the existing average) makes a population worse off, which contradicts the requirement that adding sufficiently good lives should always improve a population.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",

For Spin bordism \u03a9*^Spin(BG\u2082), the E\u2082 page is:\n\nE\u2082^{p,q} = H^p(BG\u2082; \u03a9_q^Spin(pt))\n\nSince we want the reduced theory, we're looking at the cokernel of the map:\n\u03a9\u2081\u2082^Spin(pt) \u2192 \u03a9\u2081\u2082^Spin(BG\u2082)\n\ninduced by the map pt \u2192 BG\u2082.\n\nNow, the cohomology ring H*(BG\u2082; \u2124) is known:\nH*(BG\u2082; \u2124) = \u2124[x\u2084, x\u2086, x\u2081\u2080]/(relations)\n\nwhere the subscripts indicate degrees, and x\u2084, x\u2086, x\u2081\u2080 are the basic classes.\n\nFor dimension 12, the relevant cohomology groups are:\n- H\u2070(BG\u2082; \u03a9\u2081\u2082^Spin(pt))\n- H\u2074(BG\u2082; \u03a9\u2088^Spin(pt)) \n- H\u2076(BG\u2082; \u03a9\u2086^Spin(pt))\n- H\u00b9\u00b2(BG\u2082; \u03a9\u2080^Spin(pt))\n\nSince \u03a9\u2081\u2082^Spin(pt) = \u2124 (generated by the 12-dimensional spin manifold), and the map from the point picks out the trivial bundle contribution, the reduced group is the cokernel of:\n\n\u2124 \u2192 \u03a9\u2081\u2082^Spin(BG\u2082)\n\nThe other contributions come from:\n- H\u2074(BG\u2082; \u2124/2) \u2297 \u03a9\u2088^Spin(pt) = \u2124 \u2297 \u2124/2 = \u2124/2 (from x\u2084)\n- H\u2076(BG\u2082; \u2124) \u2297 \u03a9\u2086^Spin(pt) = \u2124 \u2297 0 = 0\n- H\u00b9\u00b2(BG\u2082; \u2124) \u2297 \u03a9\u2080^Spin(pt) = H\u00b9\u00b2(BG\u2082; \u2124) \u2297 \u2124\n\nFor H\u00b9\u00b2(BG\u2082; \u2124), we need to look at monomials of degree 12 in the generators. The possibilities are x\u2084\u00b3 and x\u2086x\u2084x\u2082 (but x\u2082 doesn't exist), so we get contributions from x\u2084\u00b3.\n\nHowever, there are relations in H*(BG\u2082) that need to be accounted for. The key point is that H\u00b9\u00b2(BG\u2082; \u2124) \u2245 \u2124.\n\nPutting this together, the reduced 12th Spin bordism group is:\n\n\u03a9\u0303\u2081\u2082^Spin(BG\u2082) \u2245 \u2124/2 \u2295 \u2124\n\nThe \u2124/2 comes from the x\u2084 contribution with \u03a9\u2088^Spin(pt) = \u2124/2, and the \u2124 comes from the top-dimensional cohomology contribution.\n\nExplanation: I used the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Spin bordism of BG\u2082, computed the relevant cohomology contributions in dimension 12, and subtracted out the trivial bundle contribution to get the reduced bordism group.\n\nAnswer: \u2124/2 \u2295 \u2124\n\nConfidence: 75%",
