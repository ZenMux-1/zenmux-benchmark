            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should make a population better. Critical-level views posit that there is a critical level of welfare above zero, below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives have positive welfare. This directly conflicts with Weak Quality Addition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare (even if relatively low) should be an improvement.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",
