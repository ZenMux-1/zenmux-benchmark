            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines several conditions that a social welfare function cannot satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views are a type of population axiology that set a \"critical level\" of welfare, above which adding individuals is good and below which it is bad. These views violate the condition of Non-Elitism, which states that the welfare of a single individual should not dominate the social preference regardless of the number of others. Critical-level views can give disproportionate weight to individuals at or above the critical level, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 85%",

            "response": "Explanation:  \nWe want to compute the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\), denoted \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\). Here, \"reduced\" means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional closed Spin manifolds \\(M^{12}\\) equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle \\(P \\to M\\), up to Spin bordism with \\(G_2\\)-structure.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) induced by the basepoint inclusion, i.e., it measures the new bordism classes that arise from nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) are well-known and computed by Anderson-Brown-Peterson. In dimension 12, \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\).\n- The classifying space \\(BG_2\\) is 7-connected (since \\(G_2\\) is 14-dimensional and simply connected, and its homotopy groups start in dimension 3, but the cohomology is known to be concentrated in degrees 4 and 7).\n- The integral cohomology of \\(BG_2\\) is known: \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12 (the second Pontryagin class \\(p_2\\) and a degree 12 class), with some torsion in lower degrees.\n- The Spin bordism of \\(BG_2\\) can be computed via the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS):\n  \\[\n  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the AHSS**\n\n- Since \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is known and \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) is known, we can analyze the spectral sequence.\n- The reduced bordism corresponds to the part of the spectral sequence with \\(p > 0\\), since \\(p=0\\) corresponds to the image of \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\).\n- The main contributions to \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) come from:\n  - \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\),\n  - \\(H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*))\\), etc.\n\n- Since \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), and \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\), the AHSS terms are:\n\n  - \\(E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\),\n  - \\(E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\),\n  - \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*))\\),\n  - \\(E^2_{0,12} = H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\).\n\n- The homology groups \\(H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) and \\(H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) are known to be torsion-free and generated by the duals of the characteristic classes \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) (Pontryagin classes).\n\n- The key point is that the reduced bordism group is the part of \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) that does not come from \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\), so it corresponds to the summands with \\(p > 0\\).\n\n**Step 4: Known computations and references**\n\n- From the literature (e.g., work by Stolz, Teichner, and others on Spin bordism with structure groups), the reduced Spin bordism groups of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups in low dimensions are often free abelian groups generated by characteristic classes pulled back from \\(BG_2\\).\n- In particular, the reduced Spin bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\), generated by the bordism classes corresponding to the two independent degree 12 characteristic classes of \\(G_2\\)-bundles (e.g., the second Pontryagin class \\(p_2\\) and the degree 12 generator).\n\n**Step 5: Final answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}.\n}\n\\]\n\nThis means the reduced Spin bordism group in dimension 12 of \\(BG_2\\) is a free abelian group of rank 2.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nConfidence: 85%  \n(The answer is based on known structure of Spin bordism and characteristic classes of \\(G_2\\), but explicit computations in the literature are sparse, so there is some uncertainty.)",
