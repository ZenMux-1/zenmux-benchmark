            "response": "Critical-level views, such as critical-level utilitarianism, violate the Non-Elitism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. Non-Elitism requires that a population where all individuals have a high level of well-being is better than a population with a mix of very high and very low well-being levels, even if the latter has a higher average or total utility. Critical-level views, which assign a value to each life based on well-being minus a critical level (c), can sometimes rank a population with a few very well-off individuals and many worse-off individuals as better than a population where everyone is moderately well-off. This occurs when the high well-being of the few, adjusted for the critical level, outweighs the negative impact of the many with low well-being below the critical level, violating the egalitarian intuition behind Non-Elitism.\n\nFor example, consider a population A with 10 individuals each at well-being 10 and a critical level c = 5. The value is 10 \u00d7 (10 - 5) = 50. Population B has one individual at well-being 100 and nine at well-being 1. The value is (100 - 5) + 9 \u00d7 (1 - 5) = 95 + 9 \u00d7 (-4) = 95 - 36 = 59. Since 59 > 50, population B is considered better, despite nine individuals being much worse off than in population A. This violates Non-Elitism, which would require population A to be better.\n\nThe other conditions are generally satisfied by critical-level views:\n- **Egalitarian Dominance**: If population A has the same size as B and everyone in A has higher well-being than in B, critical-level views will rank A as better due to higher total adjusted utility.\n- **General Non-Extreme Priority**: Critical-level views, being prioritarian or utilitarian, do not inherently violate this, as they do not always prioritize small benefits to the worst-off over large benefits to the well-off.\n- **Weak Non-Sadism**: Adding a person with negative well-being is always worse than adding a person with positive well-being above the critical level, satisfying this condition.\n- **Weak Quality Addition**: Adding a person with higher positive well-being is better than adding one with lower positive well-being if both are above the critical level, and similarly for adjustments below, so this is generally satisfied.\n\nThus, the violation occurs specifically with Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C  \nConfidence: 95%",

The last author is Kevin Gimpel, and his last name ends with 'l'.\n- **c4**: Applying Rot13 to 'l' results in 'y' (since 'l' is the 12th letter, 12 + 13 = 25, which corresponds to 'y').\n- **c5**: Mars has a mass of approximately \\(6.39 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg, Earth is \\(5.97 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, and the Moon is \\(7.35 \\times 10^{22}\\) kg. The absolute difference in mass between Mars and Earth is about \\(5.331 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, while between Mars and the Moon it is about \\(5.655 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg. Since \\(5.655 \\times 10^{23} < 5.331 \\times 10^{24}\\), Mars is closer in mass to the Moon.
