            "response": "I need to analyze which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views in population ethics.\n\nCritical-level views hold that adding a new life is morally good only if that life reaches a certain positive threshold of wellbeing (the \"critical level\"). This means that adding lives with positive but below-critical-level wellbeing would make the world worse, even though these lives are worth living.\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- Egalitarian Dominance relates to preferring more equal distributions\n- General Non-Extreme Priority concerns not giving extreme priority to the worst-off\n- Non-Elitism concerns not giving excessive weight to the better-off\n- Weak Non-Sadism states that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make things worse\n- Weak Quality Addition concerns adding lives with very high welfare\n\nCritical-level views directly violate Weak Non-Sadism because they imply that adding lives with positive but below-critical-level welfare makes the world worse, even though these lives are worth living and have positive welfare.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views in population ethics hold that adding a new person is only good if their wellbeing exceeds some positive critical level. This means adding lives with positive but below-critical-level wellbeing makes the world worse. This directly contradicts Weak Non-Sadism, which states that adding lives with positive welfare (lives worth living) should not make a population worse.\n\nAnswer: D.

            "response": "I need to compute the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of the classifying space of G2. This is a complex algebraic topology problem involving bordism theory.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism group of BG2 in dimension 12 is denoted as \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2), where the tilde indicates \"reduced\" - meaning we ignore bordism classes representable by manifolds with trivial G2 bundles.\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to use spectral sequence methods and knowledge about the Spin bordism groups. The Adams spectral sequence or the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence would typically be used.\n\nFor G2, which is a compact, simply-connected exceptional Lie group of dimension 14, the computation involves understanding the cohomology of BG2 and how it relates to Spin bordism.\n\nHowever, this is an extremely specialized calculation in algebraic topology that requires detailed knowledge of spectral sequences and the specific structure of G2. Without performing the full calculation, I cannot provide the precise answer.\n\nExplanation: This problem requires specialized knowledge in algebraic topology, specifically in bordism theory and the cohomology of classifying spaces of Lie groups. The reduced Spin bordism group \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2) would require a detailed spectral sequence calculation that depends on the specific cohomology structure of BG2 and how Spin structures interact with G2 bundles. This is beyond what I can compute without reference to specialized research papers on this topic.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nConfidence: 30%",
