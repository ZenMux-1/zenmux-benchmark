            "response": "I need to recall Arrhenius's impossibility theorem and specifically identify which condition critical-level views violate.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that no population axiology can simultaneously satisfy all of several seemingly reasonable conditions. Critical-level views are those that evaluate populations based on how individual welfare compares to some critical level - only lives above this critical level contribute positively to the value of a population.\n\nThe key conditions in Arrhenius's theorem include various dominance principles, priority conditions, and restrictions on how we should treat the addition of lives at different welfare levels.\n\nCritical-level views specifically have a problem with Weak Quality Addition, which essentially states that adding lives with sufficiently high welfare should make a population better. Critical-level views violate this because they can judge that adding lives below the critical level (even if these lives have positive welfare) makes things worse, and even lives slightly above the critical level might not improve things much. This directly conflicts with the intuition behind Weak Quality Addition - that adding good enough lives should improve a population.\n\nThe other conditions are less directly violated by critical-level views:\n- Egalitarian Dominance and General Non-Extreme Priority deal with inequality\n- Non-Elitism concerns not giving excessive weight to the best-off\n- Weak Non-Sadism is about not preferring additions of lives with negative welfare\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition because they can judge that adding lives with positive welfare (but below the critical level) makes a population worse, which contradicts the principle that adding sufficiently good lives should improve a population's value.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",
