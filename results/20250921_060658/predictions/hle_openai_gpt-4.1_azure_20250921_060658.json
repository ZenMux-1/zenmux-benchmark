            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views in population ethics set a threshold (the \"critical level\") such that adding a life is only considered to make an outcome better if the life is above this threshold. This can lead to situations where adding many lives just at the threshold does not improve the outcome, which violates the \"General Non-Extreme Priority\" condition in Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. This condition roughly states that, for any two populations, if one is much larger and the additional people have lives barely worth living, then the larger population should not always be considered worse. Critical-level views can violate this by not counting lives at the critical level as improvements, regardless of how many are added.\n\nAnswer: B. General Non-Extreme Priority\nConfidence: 90%",
