This means that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare might be considered bad.\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- Egalitarian Dominance relates to preferring more equal distributions\n- General Non-Extreme Priority concerns not giving extreme priority to the worst-off\n- Non-Elitism means not preferring a small improvement for the better-off over large improvements for the worse-off\n- Weak Non-Sadism states that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make a population worse\n- Weak Quality Addition concerns adding lives with very high welfare\n\nCritical-level views specifically violate Weak Non-Sadism because they imply that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare can make a population worse. This directly contradicts the principle that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make things worse.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views in population ethics hold that adding a new person is only good if their welfare exceeds some positive critical level. This means adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare can make a population worse. This directly violates Weak Non-Sadism, which states that adding lives with positive welfare should not make a population worse.\n\nAnswer: D. Weak Non-Sadism\n\nConfidence: 95%",

This is a complex algebraic topology problem involving bordism theory.\n\nLet me analyze this step by step:\n\nThe question asks for the reduced Spin bordism group \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2), where BG2 is the classifying space of the exceptional Lie group G2.\n\nFor such computations, we typically use spectral sequences, particularly the Adams spectral sequence or the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS).\n\nFor Spin bordism of BG2, we need to consider the AHSS with:\nE\u00b2p,q = Hp(BG2; \u03a9^Spin_q(pt))\n\nThe reduced version means we're looking at the quotient \u03a9^Spin_12(BG2)/\u03a9^Spin_12(pt), which eliminates bordism classes representable by manifolds with trivial G2 bundles.\n\nFrom known results in algebraic topology:\n- \u03a9^Spin_12(pt) = Z/2 \u2295 Z/2\n- The cohomology of BG2 has specific patterns with the first non-trivial cohomology in dimension 4\n\nWorking through the spectral sequence and considering the differentials that affect the 12-dimensional part, we get:\n\nExplanation: The reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of BG2 is Z/3. This result comes from analyzing the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence and accounting for the specific cohomology structure of BG2. The key insight is that the 4-dimensional cohomology of BG2 contributes a Z/3 factor through the spectral sequence, and this survives to the 12-dimensional reduced bordism group after all differentials are considered.\n\nAnswer: Z/3\n\nConfidence: 65%",
