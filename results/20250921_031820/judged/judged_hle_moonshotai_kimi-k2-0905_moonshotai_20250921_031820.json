A routine Adams-spectral-sequence calculation (or a direct comparison with the 12-stem of MSpin) shows that in dimension 12 the only remaining classes are the ones pulled back from the generator of \u03a9\u2084^Spin=\u2124 via the map  \n\n\u03a9\u2081\u2082^Spin(BG\u2082) \u2192 \u03a9\u2084^Spin  \nthat sends a manifold with G\u2082-bundle to the zero-set of a generic section of the associated 7-dimensional vector bundle.
