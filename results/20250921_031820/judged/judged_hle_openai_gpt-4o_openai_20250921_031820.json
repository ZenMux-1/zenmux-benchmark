            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's impossibility theorems in population ethics explore the challenges in creating a satisfactory theory of population ethics that can accommodate various intuitive principles. Critical-level views are a type of population axiology that introduces a critical level of well-being, below which lives are not worth living. These views often violate certain conditions or principles that are considered desirable in population ethics. The condition that critical-level views typically violate is \"Weak Quality Addition,\" which is related to the idea that adding lives with positive welfare should not make an outcome worse if those lives are above a certain critical level. This is because critical-level views can imply that adding lives with positive welfare below the critical level can make an outcome worse, which conflicts with the principle of Weak Quality Addition.\n\nAnswer: E. Weak Quality Addition\nConfidence: 90%",

The reduced Spin bordism group \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is concerned with Spin manifolds of dimension 12 that are equipped with a map to \\( BG_2 \\), modulo those that can be represented by manifolds with trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles.\n\nThe computation of such bordism groups often involves spectral sequences, such as the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which relates the homology of the classifying space to the bordism groups. However, the specific computation of \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is a complex task that typically requires deep knowledge of both the topology of \\( BG_2 \\) and the structure of Spin bordism.\n\nIn this case, the reduced Spin bordism group \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is known to be \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\).
