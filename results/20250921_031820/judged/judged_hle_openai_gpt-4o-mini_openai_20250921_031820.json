Critical-level views typically violate the condition of \"Egalitarian Dominance,\" which states that if one alternative is preferred by all individuals over another, then the collective preference should reflect that. Critical-level views can lead to situations where a less preferred option is chosen over a universally preferred one, thus violating this condition.\n\nAnswer: A.

Its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) is a space that classifies principal \\( G_2 \\)-bundles over manifolds.\n\n2. **Spin Bordism**: Spin bordism is a type of bordism theory that takes into account the additional structure of a Spin manifold. The reduced Spin bordism, denoted \\( \\tilde{M}_n^{Spin} \\), focuses on manifolds that can be represented by Spin manifolds modulo those that can be represented by manifolds with trivial principal bundles.\n\n3. **Bordism Classes**: The reduced bordism classes can be computed using the properties of the classifying space. The reduced Spin bordism groups \\( \\tilde{M}_n^{Spin} \\) are related to the homotopy groups of the classifying space for Spin bundles.\n\n4. **Homotopy Type of \\( BG_2 \\)**: The classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) has a known homotopy type, and its cohomology can be computed. The cohomology ring \\( H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is particularly important for understanding the bordism classes.\n\n5. **Cohomology and Bordism**: The reduced Spin bordism group \\( \\tilde{M}_{12}^{Spin} \\) can be computed using the universal coefficient theorem and the relationship between cohomology and bordism. The relevant cohomology groups can be computed from the known properties of \\( G_2 \\).\n\n6. **Final Computation**: The reduced Spin bordism group \\( \\tilde{M}_{12}^{Spin} \\) is typically computed to be isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\) for dimensions that are multiples of 4, and in this case, we find that \\( \\tilde{M}_{12}^{Spin} \\) is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nThus, the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of the classifying space of the Lie group \\( G_2 \\) is:\n\nExplanation: The computation of reduced Spin bordism involves understanding the topology of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) and its relation to Spin manifolds. The reduced bordism group in this case is known to be \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\) based on the properties of the group and its classifying space.\nAnswer: \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\)\nConfidence: 90%",
