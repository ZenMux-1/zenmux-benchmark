Hence the E^2-terms listed survive to E^\u221e, and the only summand we must remove to form the reduced group is the s = 0 (MSpin_12 at the basepoint) summand Z^3. Therefore the reduced group is the direct sum of the s = 4,8,12 contributions:\nZ^2 (from s=4,t=8) \u2295 Z (from s=8,t=4) \u2295 Z^2 (from s=12,t=0) \u2245 Z^5.\n\nHowever, two of those Z summands pair up under the AHSS filtration extensions to give the free part coming from H_12(BG2) (one copy) together with the H_8 \u2297 MSpin_4 and H_4 \u2297 MSpin_8 contributions; analyzing the filtration (and using that there is no 2-torsion appearing in these summands) one finds that there are no hidden torsion extensions and the net reduced MSpin_12(BG2) is a free abelian group of rank 2.\n\nThus the reduced 12-dimensional Spin-bordism of BG2 is Z^2.\n\nAnswer: Z^2\n\nConfidence: 60%",
