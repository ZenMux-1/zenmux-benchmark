            "response": "Explanation:  \nWe are asked to compute the reduced Spin bordism group in dimension 12 of the classifying space \\(BG_2\\). Concretely, this is\n\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2),\n\\]\n\ni.e. the kernel of the natural map \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\to\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(pt)\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1.** Recall the structure of \\(\\Omega_*^{\\text{Spin}}\\). The Spin bordism ring is known up to at least dimension 16. Some facts (Anderson\u2013Brown\u2013Peterson result):\n\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_0 = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\),  \n  \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_2=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_3=0\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_4=\\mathbb{Z}\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_5=0\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_6=0\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_7=0\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_8=\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_9=0\\),  \n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{10}=0\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{11}=0\\),\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}=\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nThis matches that in even degrees multiple-of-4, the groups are free abelian (with known ranks at 4, 8, 12). In particular\n\\[\n\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(pt) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 2.** Now we want spin bordism of \\(BG_2\\). Strategy: Use the Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch Spectral Sequence (AHSS):\n\n\\[\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_q) \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{p+q}(BG_2).\n\\]\n\nThe \"reduced\" subgroup removes the summand mapping back to \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}\\) from the \\(p=0\\) column. So we care about contributions with \\(p>0\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3.** Compute the relevant \\(E^2\\) page terms in total degree \\(12\\).\n\nWe need \\(p+q=12\\). Possible \\(q\\) with nonzero \\(\\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}}:\\) \\(q=0,1,2,4,8,12\\). So:\n\n- \\(q=0, p=12\\): term = \\(H_{12}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z})\\).\n- \\(q=1, p=11\\): term = \\(H_{11}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}/2)\\).\n- \\(q=2, p=10\\): term = \\(H_{10}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}/2)\\).\n- \\(q=4, p=8\\): term = \\(H_{8}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z})\\).\n- \\(q=8, p=4\\): term = \\(H_{4}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z})\\).\n- \\(q=12, p=0\\): term = \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\). But this lives in the unreduced group and is precisely the part we remove for the reduced group.\n\nSo the reduced group will be contributions from the other bullets.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4.** Compute homology of \\(BG_2\\). The Lie group \\(G_2\\) is simply connected, compact, rank 2. The cohomology ring is known: \\(H^*(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}[c_2,c_6]\\), where \\(c_2\\) in degree 4, \\(c_6\\) in degree 12. Because \\(G_2\\) is simply connected, indeed \\(BG_2\\) has cohomology polynomial ring generated in degree 4 and 12. So:\n\n\\[\nH^*(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}], \\; |x_4|=4, |x_{12}|=12.\n\\]\n\nLet's compute low-degree homology groups by universal coefficients. Since cohomology is torsion-free, so homology is also torsion-free. Indeed the cohomology ring is polynomial in integral generators \u2013 no torsion. Then by universal coefficient theorem, \\(H_i(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z})\\) is free abelian. Now:\n\n- \\(H^0 = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(H^4 = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(H^8 = \\mathbb{Z}\\) (generated by \\(x_4^2\\)).\n- \\(H^{12} = \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\) (generated by \\(x_4^3\\) and \\(x_{12}\\)).\n\nThus homology groups are in complementary degrees. But we are not aiming to enumerate all explicitly. All these cohomology groups are torsion-free. As a consequence, \\(H_{odd}(BG_2)=0\\). Specifically, for \\(H_i\\): It's free abelian in even degrees that are sums of 4\u2019s and 12\u2019s; vanishes in odd degrees.\n\nConcretely:\n- \\(H_4(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(H_8(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(H_{12}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\n- \\(H_{10}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0\\).\n- \\(H_{11}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z})=0\\).\n\nSo all necessary terms are known.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5.** Compute each term.  \n\n- For \\((p=12,q=0)\\): \\(H_{12}(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\n- For \\((p=11,q=1)\\): 0.\n- For \\((p=10,q=2)\\): 0.\n- For \\((p=8,q=4)\\): \\(H_8(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- For \\((p=4,q=8)\\): \\(H_4(BG_2;\\mathbb{Z})\\otimes (\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- For \\((p=0,q=12)\\): \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) (but remove in reduced version).\n\nSo potentially contributing classes: \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^5\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6.** Check for differentials. In AHSS, differentials \\(d_r: E^r_{p,q}\\to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1}\\). We need to check if any of the above groups could be killed by differentials.\n\nBecause cohomology has no torsion, the potential tricky parts come from 2-torsion in the Spin bordism coefficients. However in our relevant ranges, \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_q\\) for q>0 in play were at q=4,8,12, all of which are torsion-free. The only Spin bordism groups having 2 torsion are q=1,2. But those had p=11,10, and with \\(H_{odd}=0\\), those vanish. So there is no 2-torsion sources. That means no possible differentials affecting our surviving groups. Because differentials in AHSS are torsion operations (Steenrod squares on homology), but with no torsion we get nothing.\n\nHence the AHSS collapses at \\(E_2\\) and no extensions.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7.** Conclusion. Thus  \n\\[\n\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}^2\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^2)\\oplus(\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\text{ from the p=0 column})\n\\]\n\\(\\cong \\mathbb{Z}^7.\\)\n\nTherefore the reduced group (modulo the summand from trivial bundles, i.e. remove p=0 part) is \\(\\mathbb{Z}^5.\\)\n\n---\n\nAnswer: \\(\\displaystyle \\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5.\\)\n\nConfidence: 95%",
