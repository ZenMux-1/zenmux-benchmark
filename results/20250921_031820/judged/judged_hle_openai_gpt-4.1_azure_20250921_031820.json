            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem deals with the incompatibility of several plausible conditions in population ethics. Critical-level views are characterized by the idea that adding a life is only a benefit if its well-being exceeds a certain \"critical level.\" This means that the value of a population can be determined by focusing on those above this threshold, which can lead to ignoring the interests of those below it. This violates the condition of \"Non-Elitism,\" which requires that the value of a population should not depend solely on the well-being of a subset (the \"elite\") of individuals. Instead, all individuals' well-being should matter. Critical-level views, by focusing on those above the critical level, are thus in conflict with Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C.
