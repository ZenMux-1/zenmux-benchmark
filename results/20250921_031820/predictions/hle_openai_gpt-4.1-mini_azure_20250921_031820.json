            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines conditions that no population axiology can satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views are a type of population axiology that incorporate a \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding individuals can decrease overall value. These views are known to violate the condition of Non-Elitism, which states that adding individuals with very low welfare should not make a population better off than one with only high welfare individuals. Critical-level views can prioritize populations with higher welfare individuals and exclude or devalue those with welfare below the critical level, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C.

The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional Spin manifolds equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, up to Spin bordism.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\(BG_2 \\to *\\), so it measures the \"new\" bordism classes that arise from nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts about Spin bordism**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) are well-known and computed by Anderson-Brown-Peterson.\n- In dimension 12, \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\).\n- The free part is generated by products of quaternionic projective planes and other known manifolds.\n\n**Step 3: Cohomology and characteristic classes of \\(BG_2\\)**\n\n- \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, exceptional Lie group of rank 2.\n- The cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is known to be a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n  \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are characteristic classes associated to the \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n- The class \\(x_4\\) corresponds to the first Pontryagin class of the associated 7-dimensional vector bundle (the fundamental representation of \\(G_2\\) is 7-dimensional).\n\n**Step 4: Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)**\n\n- To compute \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\), one can use the AHSS:\n  \\[\n  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n  \\]\n- Since \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) is known and \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) is torsion-free and concentrated in even degrees (because \\(BG_2\\) has polynomial cohomology in even degrees), the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\) modulo extension problems.\n\n**Step 5: Low-degree Spin bordism groups**\n\n- \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\n\n**Step 6: Compute \\(E^2\\) page terms with total degree 12**\n\nWe look for pairs \\((p,q)\\) with \\(p+q=12\\):\n\n- \\(p=0, q=12\\): \\(H_0(BG_2;
