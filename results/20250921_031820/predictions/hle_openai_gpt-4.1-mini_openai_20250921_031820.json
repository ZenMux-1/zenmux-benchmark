            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines conditions that no critical-level utilitarian view can satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views are designed to avoid the repugnant conclusion by introducing a \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding lives is not considered beneficial. However, these views violate the condition of Non-Elitism, which states that the welfare of a few individuals should not dominate the evaluation of the population's overall welfare. Critical-level views can give disproportionate weight to individuals at or above the critical level, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 90%",

The \"reduced\" part means we consider only those bordism classes that come from nontrivial principal \\(G_2\\)-bundles over Spin 12-manifolds, i.e., we mod out by the image of the map induced by the trivial bundle \\( \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and notation**  \n- \\(\\Omega_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(X)\\) is the Spin bordism group of the space \\(X\\).\n- \\(BG_2\\) is the classifying space of the exceptional Lie group \\(G_2\\).\n- The reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\(pt \\to BG_2\\), or equivalently the cokernel of the map \\(\\Omega_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt) \\to \\Omega_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Known facts about \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt)\\)**  \nThe Spin bordism groups of a point are well-known (from the work of Anderson-Brown-Peterson and others):\n\n\\[\n\\Omega_n^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt) \\cong\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathbb{Z} & n=0,4,8, \\\\\n\\mathbb{Z}_2 & n=1,2, \\\\\n0 & n=3,5,6,7, \\\\\n\\mathbb{Z}^2 & n=12, \\text{ etc.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nMore precisely, \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\). The two generators can be taken as certain 12-dimensional Spin manifolds, e.g., products of quaternionic projective spaces or other known manifolds.\n\n**Step 3: The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)**  \nTo compute \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\), we use the AHSS:\n\n\\[\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n\\]\n\nWe want the total degree \\(p+q=12\\).\n\n**Step 4: Cohomology of \\(BG_2\\)**  \nThe integral cohomology ring of \\(BG_2\\) is known:\n\n\\[\nH^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}],\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(x_4\\) is a generator in degree 4 and \\(x_{12}\\) in degree 12. There are no torsion classes in low degrees, and the homology groups \\(H_p(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) are free abelian in these degrees.\n\nBy universal coefficients, the homology groups relevant for \\(p \\leq 12\\) are:\n\n- \\(H_0(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\),\n- \\(H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\),\n- \\(H_{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\),\n- and zero in other degrees relevant for the spectral sequence (since the cohomology is polynomial on two generators).\n\n**Step 5: Compute \\(E^2\\)-page terms with total degree 12**\n\nWe consider all pairs \\((p,q)\\) with \\(p+q=12\\):\n\n- \\(p=0, q=12\\): \\(H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt)) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt) = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\n- \\(p=4, q=8\\): \\(H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt)) = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n- \\(p=8, q=4\\): \\(H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(pt)) = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\).

These represent bordism classes of Spin 12-manifolds equipped with nontrivial principal \\(G_2\\)-bundles classified by the characteristic classes \\(x_4\\), \\(x_4^2\\), and \\(x_{12}\\).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3}\\).\n\nConfidence: 95%  \n(The computation relies on well-known facts about Spin bordism and the cohomology of \\(BG_2\\), and the AHSS collapses in this range.
