Critical-level views typically violate the condition of \"Egalitarian Dominance,\" which asserts that if one alternative is preferred by a majority over another, then the collective preference should reflect that majority preference without being overridden by the critical levels of other alternatives. Critical-level views can lead to situations where the preferences of a minority can dominate the decision-making process, thus violating the egalitarian principle.\n\nAnswer: A.

Its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) is a space that classifies principal \\( G_2 \\)-bundles over other spaces.\n\n2. **Spin Bordism**: Spin bordism is a type of bordism theory that classifies manifolds up to the notion of being \"spin,\" which means they have a spin structure (a certain type of lifting of the frame bundle). The reduced bordism, denoted \\( \\tilde{M}_n \\), focuses on classes of manifolds that can be represented by manifolds with non-trivial principal bundles.\n\n3. **Bordism Groups**: The reduced Spin bordism groups \\( \\tilde{M}_n \\) can be computed using the stable homotopy groups of spheres and the properties of the classifying spaces. For \\( n = 12 \\), we are particularly interested in \\( \\tilde{M}_{12} \\).\n\n4. **Classifying Space and Homotopy Type**: The classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) has a known homotopy type, and its cohomology can be computed. The cohomology ring \\( H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is particularly important for understanding the bordism classes.\n\n5. **Cohomology and Bordism**: The reduced Spin bordism group \\( \\tilde{M}_{12} \\) can be related to the cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\). The key is to find the relevant cohomology classes that correspond to the Spin structures.\n\n6. **Final Computation**: The reduced Spin bordism group \\( \\tilde{M}_{12} \\) is typically computed using the universal coefficient theorem and the known results about the cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\). For \\( G_2 \\), it is known that \\( \\tilde{M}_{12} \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nThus, the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of the classifying space of the Lie group \\( G_2 \\) is:\n\nExplanation: The computation relies on the properties of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) and its relation to Spin bordism, leading to the conclusion that \\( \\tilde{M}_{12} \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\).\nAnswer: \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\)\nConfidence: 90%",
