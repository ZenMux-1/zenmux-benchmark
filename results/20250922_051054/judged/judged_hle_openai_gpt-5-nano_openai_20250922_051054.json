The E\u00b2-page is\nE\u00b2_{p,q} = H_p(BG\u2082; \u03a9_q^Spin(pt)),\nand the total degree is p + q = 12. The map to a point (augmentation BG\u2082 \u2192 pt) kills the p = 0 row, so the reduced group is generated by the p > 0 contributions surviving to E\u221e.\n\nFacts we use (standard):\n- \u03a9_q^Spin(pt) for small q: \u03a9_0^Spin \u2245 Z, \u03a9_4^Spin \u2245 Z, \u03a9_8^Spin \u2245 Z \u2295 Z_2, \u03a9_12^Spin \u2245 Z \u2295 Z_2 \u2295 Z_2 \u2295 Z_2 (up to extensions; the precise torsion structure will not affect the final reduced group in a straightforward way since we only need the p > 0 contributions in degree 12).\n- BG\u2082 has only even-degree integral cohomology with the first nontrivial classes in degrees 4 and 12 (corresponding to the basic invariant polynomials of degrees 2 and 6 for G\u2082). Consequently H_4(BG\u2082; Z) \u2245 Z and H_12(BG\u2082; Z) \u2245 Z, with the other H_p(BG\u2082; Z) for 0 < p < 12 vanishing (or contributing only torsion that does not affect degree 12 in this setup).\n\nThus, in total degree 12, the relevant E\u00b2 terms are:\n- E\u00b2_{12,0} \u2245 H_12(BG\u2082; \u03a9_0^Spin(pt)) \u2245 Z\n- E\u00b2_{4,8} \u2245 H_4(BG\u2082; \u03a9_8^Spin(pt)) \u2245 H_4(BG\u2082; Z) \u2295 H_4(BG\u2082; Z_2) \u2245 Z \u2295 Z_2\n- E\u00b2_{0,12} \u2245 H_0(BG\u2082; \u03a9_12^Spin(pt)) \u2245 \u03a9_12^Spin(pt) \u2245 Z \u2295 (torsion)\n\nThe possible differentials into or out of these groups that could affect degree 12 would have to originate from or land in odd q (where \u03a9_q^Spin(pt) vanishes) or violate degree constraints; in this range those differentials vanish, so these E\u00b2-terms survive to E\u221e.\n\nThe map to a point kills the p = 0 piece, so the reduced group \u03a9\u0303\u2081\u2082^Spin(BG\u2082) picks up exactly the p = 4,8 and p = 12 contributions with p > 0:\n\u03a9\u0303\u2081\u2082^Spin(BG\u2082) \u2245 E\u221e_{4,8} \u2295 E\u221e_{12,0} \u2245 (Z \u2295 Z_2) \u2295 Z.\n\nHence\n\u03a9\u0303\u2081\u2082^Spin(BG\u2082) \u2245 Z^2 \u2295 Z_2.\n\nThis group is generated by:\n- a class coming from a 4-cycle in BG\u2082 with an \u03a9_8^Spin(pt) fiber (the Z \u2295 Z_2 summand in \u03a9_8^Spin(pt)),\n- a class coming from a 12-cycle in BG\u2082 with the trivial fibration over it (the Z summand from \u03a9_0^Spin(pt)),\ntogether with the base torsion Z_2 coming from the \u03a9_8^Spin(pt) factor in the p = 4,8 contribution.\n\nAnswer: \u03a9\u0303\u2081\u2082^Spin(BG\u2082) \u2245 Z^2 \u2295 Z_2\n\nConfidence: 0.38",
