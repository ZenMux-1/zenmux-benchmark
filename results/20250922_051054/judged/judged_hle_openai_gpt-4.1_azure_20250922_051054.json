Critical-level views are theories that only count lives as contributing positively to overall value if their well-being exceeds a certain \"critical level.\" This means that adding lives below this level does not improve the outcome, which can violate the principle that adding lives with positive welfare should not make an outcome worse. The condition most directly violated by critical-level views is \"Weak Quality Addition,\" which states that adding a life with positive welfare should not make an outcome worse.\n\nAnswer: E. Weak Quality Addition\nConfidence: 95%",
