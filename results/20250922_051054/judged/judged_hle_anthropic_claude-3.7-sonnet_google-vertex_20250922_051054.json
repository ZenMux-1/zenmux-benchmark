This means that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare might be considered negative.\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- Egalitarian Dominance relates to preferring more equal distributions\n- General Non-Extreme Priority concerns not giving extreme priority to the worst-off\n- Non-Elitism states we shouldn't prefer a smaller population with slightly higher welfare over a much larger population with slightly lower welfare\n- Weak Non-Sadism states that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make a population worse\n- Weak Quality Addition concerns adding lives with very high welfare being positive\n\nCritical-level views specifically violate Weak Non-Sadism because they imply that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare can make a population worse. This directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism condition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare should never make a population worse.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views in population ethics hold that adding a new life is only morally good if that life has welfare above some positive critical level. This means adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare can make a population worse, which directly violates the Weak Non-Sadism condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem.

            "response": "I need to compute the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of the classifying space of G2. This is a highly specialized question in algebraic topology.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism group of BG2 in dimension 12 is denoted as \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2). To compute this, I need to consider the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) that relates the Spin bordism of a point to the Spin bordism of BG2.\n\nFor G2, which is a compact, simply connected exceptional Lie group, we know that:\n- \u03c0_3(G2) = Z\n- H^4(BG2; Z) = Z, generated by the first Pontryagin class p1\n- H^8(BG2; Z) = Z, generated by a class related to the second Pontryagin class\n\nIn dimension 12, the reduced Spin bordism would involve understanding the differentials in the AHSS and the possible extensions. Based on results in the literature, particularly work by Minami and others on Spin bordism of classifying spaces:\n\n\u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2) \u2245 Z/3Z\n\nThis is because the 12-dimensional Spin bordism of a point is known to be Z\u2295Z/2Z, and the reduced bordism in this case captures a Z/3Z component that arises from the specific structure of G2 bundles.\n\nExplanation: The reduced Spin bordism group \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2) is computed using spectral sequence techniques. The key insight is that in dimension 12, there is a Z/3Z torsion component that survives in the spectral sequence and is not killed by any differentials. This torsion component is related to the characteristic classes of G2 bundles and cannot be represented by manifolds with trivial G2 bundles.\n\nAnswer: Z/3Z\n\nConfidence: 70%",
