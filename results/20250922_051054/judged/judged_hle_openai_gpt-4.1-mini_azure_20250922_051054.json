The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional Spin manifolds equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, up to bordism.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) induced by the basepoint inclusion.\n- Since \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is the 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of a point, known from classical computations.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) are known from the work of Anderson-Brown-Peterson and others. In particular:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\n  \\]\n  (This is a classical result; the free part is generated by certain characteristic numbers, and there is a 2-torsion summand.)\n\n- The classifying space \\(BG_2\\) is 7-connected (since \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, simple Lie group of dimension 14 and rank 2). Its cohomology is known:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n  \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) is in degree 4 and \\(x_{12}\\) in degree 12, with no torsion in low degrees.\n\n- The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for Spin bordism:\n  \\[\n  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the AHSS**\n\n- Since \\(BG_2\\) has no homology below degree 4 (due to connectivity), the first nontrivial homology groups appear in degree 4 and 12.\n- The relevant terms for total degree 12 are:\n  - \\(E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{0,12} = H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\\)\n\n- Since \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), and \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\), we have:\n  - \\(E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}^2)\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{0,12} = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\)\n\n- The homology groups \\(H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by the dual of \\(x_4\\), and \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by the dual of \\(x_{12}\\). \\(H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is zero because there is no generator in degree 8 in cohomology.\n\n- So the only nonzero terms are:\n  - \\(E^2_{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{0,12} = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\n\n**Step 4: Differentials and extensions**\n\n- The differentials in the AHSS for Spin bordism are known to be complicated, but in this range, the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\) or \\(E^3\\) because of degree reasons and the absence of torsion in \\(H_*(BG_2)\\).\n\n- Therefore, the group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) fits into an extension involving these groups.\n\n- The reduced bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\n  \\]\n  which corresponds to the summand \\(E^2_{0,12}\\).\n\n- Hence, the reduced group is generated by the terms with positive homological degree in \\(BG_2\\), i.e., the summands \\(E^2_{12,0}\\) and \\(E^2_{4,8}\\).\n\n- Since \\(E^2_{8,4} = 0\\), the reduced group is:\n  \\[\n  \\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}})\n  \\]\n\n- Recall \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), so:\n  \\[\n  H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\cong H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n\n- And \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n**Step 5: Final result**\n\nPutting it all together:\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nThis means the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of \\(BG_2\\) is free abelian of rank 3.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reduced bordism ignores the trivial bundle classes (the basepoint summand).\n- The nontrivial classes come from the homology of \\(BG_2\\) in degrees 4 and 12, tensored with the Spin bordism groups in complementary degrees.\n- The result is a free abelian group of rank 3.\n\n---\n\nAnswer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3\n}\n\\]\n\nConfidence: 90%  \n(The main uncertainty comes from possible subtle torsion or extension issues in the AHSS, but given the known cohomology and Spin bordism groups, this is the standard expected answer.)",
