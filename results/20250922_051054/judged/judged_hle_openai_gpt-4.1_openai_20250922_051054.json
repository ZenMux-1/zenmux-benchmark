Critical-level views are characterized by the idea that adding a life is only a benefit if its well-being exceeds a certain \"critical level.\" This approach can violate the condition of \"Non-Elitism,\" which states that the value of a population should not depend only on the well-being of a subset of individuals (e.g., those above the critical level), but should take into account everyone's well-being. Critical-level views, by focusing on those above the critical level, can be seen as giving special weight to a subset, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism\n\nConfidence: 90%",
