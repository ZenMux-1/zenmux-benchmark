            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above some critical level should make a population better. Critical-level views hold that there is some positive welfare level above zero below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives are worth living. This directly contradicts the Weak Quality Addition condition, which requires that adding lives with positive welfare (above the critical level) should improve the overall situation.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%\n\nThe reason I'm not 100% confident is that population ethics is a complex field with ongoing debates about the interpretation of various conditions. However, based on my understanding of both critical-level views and Arrhenius's impossibility theorem, Weak Quality Addition is the condition that is most clearly violated by critical-level utilitarianism.",
