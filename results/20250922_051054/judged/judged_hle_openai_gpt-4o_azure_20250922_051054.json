Critical-level views propose that adding individuals with a quality of life above a certain critical level is good, while adding individuals below that level is bad. This perspective can conflict with the condition of **Weak Non-Sadism**, which states that adding individuals with lives worth living should not make an outcome worse. Critical-level views may violate this condition because they imply that adding individuals with lives just barely worth living (but below the critical level) could make an outcome worse, which contradicts Weak Non-Sadism.\n\nAnswer: D.

For \\(G_2\\), the cohomology is generated by classes in degrees 4 and 12:\n   \\[\n   H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}],\n   \\]\n   where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are generators in degrees 4 and 12, respectively.\n\n4. **AHSS for \\(BG_2\\)**: The AHSS for \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{*}(BG_2)\\) starts with \\(E_2^{p,q} = H^p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}})\\). The differentials \\(d_r\\) act on these groups, and the \\(E_\\infty\\)-page gives the associated graded of a filtration of \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{*}(BG_2)\\).\n\n5. **Reduced Bordism**: The \"reduced\" bordism means we are interested in the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(\\text{pt})\\), which corresponds to bordism classes that vanish when the \\(G_2\\)-bundle is trivial.\n\n### Computation for Dimension 12:\n\n- The relevant Spin bordism groups are:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}.\n  \\]\n\n- The cohomology \\(H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is generated by \\(x_{12}\\), so \\(E_2^{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n- The reduced bordism corresponds to classes in \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) that are nontrivial due to the \\(G_2\\)-structure. These are detected by the image of \\(x_{12}\\) in the AHSS.\n\n- Since \\(x_{12}\\) is the top generator in \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\), it contributes a \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) summand to the reduced bordism group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism of \\(BG_2\\) is \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), generated by the class corresponding to \\(x_{12}\\).\n\nExplanation: The computation uses the AHSS and the known structure of \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) and \\(\\Omega_*^{\\text{Spin}}\\). The reduced bordism focuses on classes arising from the \\(G_2\\)-structure, which are detected by \\(x_{12}\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\nConfidence: 90%",
