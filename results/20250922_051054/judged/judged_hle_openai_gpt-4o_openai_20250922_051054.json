            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's impossibility theorems in population ethics explore the challenges in creating a moral theory that satisfies several intuitive conditions simultaneously. Critical-level views in population ethics suggest that adding individuals with a quality of life below a certain critical level does not make an outcome better. This view can conflict with certain conditions in Arrhenius's theorems. Specifically, critical-level views can violate the condition of \"Weak Quality Addition,\" which suggests that adding individuals with a positive quality of life should make an outcome better. Since critical-level views can imply that adding individuals with a quality of life below the critical level does not improve the outcome, they violate this condition.\n\nAnswer: E.

The group \\( G_2 \\) is one of the exceptional Lie groups, and its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) is a space that classifies principal \\( G_2 \\)-bundles. The reduced bordism group in this context refers to the bordism classes of manifolds with non-trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles.\n\nThe Spin bordism group \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_n(X)\\) for a space \\(X\\) is the group of bordism classes of \\(n\\)-dimensional Spin manifolds with a map to \\(X\\). The reduced bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_n(X)\\) is the kernel of the map from \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_n(X)\\) to \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_n\\), which forgets the map to \\(X\\).\n\nFor \\(BG_2\\), we are interested in \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\). The group \\(G_2\\) is 14-dimensional, and its classifying space \\(BG_2\\) has a rich topology. The computation of Spin bordism groups often involves understanding the homotopy groups of the classifying space and the characteristic classes that can be defined on it.\n\nIn particular, the reduced Spin bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is related to the image of the stable homotopy groups of spheres in the homotopy groups of \\(BG_2\\), as well as the characteristic classes of \\(G_2\\)-bundles. The group \\(G_2\\) has a non-trivial 3-dimensional homotopy group, and its classifying space has non-trivial cohomology in dimensions that are multiples of 4, which can affect the bordism groups.\n\nThe specific computation of \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is a complex task that typically requires advanced techniques in algebraic topology, such as spectral sequences and the use of known results about the homotopy groups of spheres and the cohomology of \\(BG_2\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\nConfidence: 70%",
