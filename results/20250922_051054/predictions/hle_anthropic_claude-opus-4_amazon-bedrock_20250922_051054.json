            "response": "I need to recall Arrhenius's impossibility theorem and specifically identify which condition critical-level views violate.\n\nArrhenius's impossibility theorem demonstrates that no population ethics theory can simultaneously satisfy all of his proposed conditions. Critical-level views are theories that evaluate populations based on whether individuals' welfare levels exceed some critical threshold.\n\nCritical-level views specifically violate the Weak Quality Addition condition. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare that are above some sufficiently high level should not make a population worse. However, critical-level views can judge the addition of lives with positive welfare below the critical level as making things worse, even if those lives have welfare well above neutrality. This directly contradicts Weak Quality Addition.\n\nThe other conditions are not specifically violated by critical-level views:\n- Egalitarian Dominance and General Non-Extreme Priority deal with inequality\n- Non-Elitism concerns discrimination between different groups\n- Weak Non-Sadism is about not preferring suffering\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition because they can judge the addition of lives worth living (with positive welfare) as making a population worse if those lives fall below the critical level, even when those lives have welfare significantly above zero.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",
