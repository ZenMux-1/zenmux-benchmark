            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should make a population better. Critical-level views posit that there is a critical level of welfare above zero, below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives are worth living. This directly conflicts with Weak Quality Addition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare (even if relatively low) should improve the overall situation. The critical level approach essentially creates a threshold that can reject the addition of some positive welfare lives, contrary to what Weak Quality Addition requires.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 90%",

The reduced Spin bordism groups of BG2 in dimension 12 involve complex calculations using spectral sequences and characteristic classes. Without access to detailed computations, I cannot provide a definitive answer. This would require knowledge of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Spin bordism and detailed understanding of the cohomology of BG2.\n\nAnswer: I cannot provide a specific answer to this computation.\n\nConfidence: 10%\n\nI have very low confidence because this is a specialized calculation that would require careful mathematical analysis and access to specific tools and references in algebraic topology.
