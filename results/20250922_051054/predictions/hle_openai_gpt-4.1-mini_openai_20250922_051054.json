            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines conditions that a critical-level utilitarian view cannot satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views typically violate the condition known as \"Non-Elitism,\" which states that the welfare of any individual should not be disregarded or considered irrelevant simply because they belong to a particular group or population segment. Critical-level views assign a baseline or \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding lives can be seen as negative, which conflicts with the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 85%",

The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional closed Spin manifolds equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, up to Spin bordism.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) induced by the basepoint inclusion.\n- Since \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is the usual 12-dimensional Spin bordism group, the reduced group measures the new classes arising from nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts about Spin bordism**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) are known from the work of Milnor, Anderson-Brown-Peterson, and others.\n- In dimension 12, \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\), generated by certain characteristic numbers (e.g., \\(\\hat{A}\\)-genus and other invariants).\n- The torsion part is \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\).\n\n**Step 3: Cohomology of \\(BG_2\\)**\n\n- The Lie group \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, exceptional Lie group of rank 2.\n- The integral cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is known to be a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n  \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are characteristic classes associated to the \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n- The class \\(x_4\\) corresponds to the first Pontryagin class of the associated vector bundle (since \\(G_2 \\subset SO(7)\\)), and \\(x_{12}\\) is a higher-degree characteristic class.\n\n**Step 4: Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)**\n\n- To compute \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\), one uses the AHSS:\n  \\[\n  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n  \\]\n- Since \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is known and \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) is dual to \\(H^*(BG_2)\\), we can analyze the spectral sequence.\n\n**Step 5: Low-degree Spin bordism groups**\n\n- \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\n\n**Step 6: Relevant terms for total degree 12**\n\nWe look at \\(p+q=12\\):\n\n- \\(p=0, q=12\\): \\(H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\n- \\(p=4, q=8\\): \\(H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) (since \\(H_4(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by \\(x_4\\))\n- \\(p=8, q=4\\): \\(H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n- \\(p=12, q=0\\): \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n\nFrom the cohomology ring, \\(H^8(BG_2) = 0\\) (since generators are in degrees 4 and 12 only), so \\(H_8(BG_2) = 0\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\(H_{12}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by the dual of \\(x_{12}\\).\n\n**Step 7: Summary of \\(E^2\\)-page terms**\n\n- \\(E^2_{0,12} = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\n- \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2;
