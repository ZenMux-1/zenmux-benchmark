            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines conditions that a critical-level utilitarian view cannot satisfy simultaneously. Critical-level views typically violate the condition known as \"Non-Elitism,\" which states that the welfare of any individual should not be disregarded or considered irrelevant simply because they belong to a particular group or population segment. Critical-level views assign a baseline or \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding lives can be seen as negative, which conflicts with the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 85%",
