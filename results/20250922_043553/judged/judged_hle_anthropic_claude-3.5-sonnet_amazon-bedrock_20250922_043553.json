            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should make a population better. Critical-level views posit that there is a critical level of welfare above zero, below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives have positive welfare. This directly contradicts the Weak Quality Addition condition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare (above some level) should be an improvement. The other conditions mentioned (Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, and Weak Non-Sadism) are not specifically violated by critical-level views in the same direct way.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 90%",
