The E2-page is E2_{p,q} = H_p(BG2; MSpin_q(pt)), and \u043c\u044b consider the reduced theory, so the p = 0 column (which corresponds to the base point) is removed. Since BG2 has integral cohomology H^*(BG2; Z) = Z[x4, x12] with x4 in degree 4 and x12 in degree 12, its homology H_p(BG2; Z) is nonzero only in even degrees, in particular p \u2208 {0, 4, 8, 12}, with H_0 \u2245 Z, H_4 \u2245 Z, H_8 \u2245 Z, H_12 \u2245 Z, and no odd-degree homology (as BG2 is 1-connected and H^*(BG2; Z) has no odd-degree classes). For total degree 12 and p \u2265 1, the only potential p, q pairs are (12,0), (8,4), and (4,8) (ignoring higher p with q negative or p = 0). The corresponding coefficient groups are:\n- E2_{12,0} \u2245 H_12(BG2; Z) \u2245 Z\n- E2_{8,4} \u2245 H_8(BG2; Z) \u2297 MSpin_4(pt) \u2245 Z \u2297 Z \u2245 Z\n- E2_{4,8} \u2245 H_4(BG2; Z) \u2297 MSpin_8(pt) \u2245 Z \u2297 MSpin_8(pt)\n\nThere are also torsion contributions from MSpin_q(pt) with q > 0, but reduced-ness and the known structure of MSpin_*(pt) together with the vanishing of certain low-degree mod-2 and odd-degree pieces in H_*(BG2; Z) force the higher differentials to kill the potential torsion and keep only the primary even-degree piece arising from q = 0, p = 12. In particular, the only surviving geometric class in total degree 12 in the reduced theory is the one coming from the orientation class in MSpin_12(pt) pulled back along BG2 \u2192 pt, i.e. the p = 12, q = 0 contribution, which yields a copy of Z. The other potential contributions either cancel under differentials or vanish due to coefficient structure and the reduced setup.\n\nThus, the reduced 12-th Spin bordism of BG2 is a free abelian group of rank 1, i.e. Z.\n\nAnswer: Z\n\nConfidence: 25%",
