Critical-level views are a type of population axiology that introduce a \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding individuals can decrease overall value. This approach violates the condition of Non-Elitism, which states that the welfare of a population should not be dominated by a small elite subgroup. Critical-level views can give disproportionate weight to individuals above the critical level, effectively violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 85%",

The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional Spin manifolds equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, up to Spin bordism.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) induced by the basepoint inclusion.\n- Since \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is the 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of a point, known from classical computations.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) are known from the work of Anderson-Brown-Peterson and others. In particular:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\n  \\]\n  (This is a classical result; the free \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) summand is generated by the signature operator index, and the torsion summands come from subtle invariants.)\n\n- The classifying space \\(BG_2\\) is 7-connected (since \\(G_2\\) is 14-dimensional and simply connected, and \\(BG_2\\) has homotopy groups shifted by one dimension). Its cohomology is known to be polynomial on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n  \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are characteristic classes associated to the \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)**\n\nThe AHSS for Spin bordism with coefficients in \\(BG_2\\) has:\n\\[\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\n\\]\n\nWe want total degree 12, so \\(p+q=12\\).\n\n- Since \\(BG_2\\) is simply connected and has no homology below degree 4, the low-degree homology groups vanish:\n  \\[\n  H_0(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n  and other homology groups in degrees less than 12 are zero or torsion-free.\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) for \\(q \\leq 12\\) are known and mostly torsion-free or 2-torsion.\n\n**Step 4: Identify possible contributions**\n\nThe \\(E^2\\)-page terms with \\(p+q=12\\) are:\n- \\(E^2_{0,12} = H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\\)\n- \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*))\\)\n- \\(E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*))\\)\n- \\(E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nRecall:\n- \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\) (generated by the quaternionic projective plane and the Bott manifold)\n- \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) (generated by the K3 surface or \\(\\mathbb{CP}^2\\) with appropriate Spin structure)\n- \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nAlso, \\(H_8(BG_2) = 0\\) because the cohomology ring is generated in degrees 4 and 12 only, so no 8-dimensional homology.\n\nTherefore:\n- \\(E^2_{8,4} = 0\\)\n- \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(E^2_{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\n**Step 5: Differential considerations**\n\nThe differentials in the AHSS for Spin bordism are known to be related to Steenrod operations and characteristic classes. Since \\(BG_2\\) has no torsion in homology and the groups involved are torsion-free or 2-torsion, the differentials are expected to vanish or be trivial in this range.\n\nHence, the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\) or \\(E^3\\).\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the pieces**\n\nThe filtration gives:\n\\[\n0 \\to F^1 \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to E^\\infty_{0,12} \\to 0\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nF^1 / F^2 \\cong E^\\infty_{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nF^2 \\cong E^\\infty_{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nSo the group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) fits into an extension:\n\\[\n0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to 0\n\\]\n\nBut the last summand \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\\) is the image of the basepoint inclusion (the Spin bordism of a point), so the reduced group is the kernel of the map to \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\).\n\nTherefore, the reduced group is:\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\ncoming from the \\(E^\\infty_{4,8}\\) and \\(E^\\infty_{12,0}\\) terms, i.e., from the nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle classes.\n\n**Step 7: Interpretation**\n\n- The \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) summand in degree 12 homology corresponds to the characteristic class \\(x_{12}\\).\n- The \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) summand in degree 4 homology paired with \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) corresponds to the class \\(x_4\\) paired with an 8-dimensional Spin manifold.\n\nHence, the reduced Spin bordism group in dimension 12 of \\(BG_2\\) is free abelian of rank 2.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nAnswer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\n}\n\\]\n\nConfidence: 90%  \n(The computation relies on known Spin bordism groups, the cohomology of \\(BG_2\\), and the structure of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. The main uncertainty is in possible extension problems or differentials, but these are expected to be trivial in this range.)",
