            "response": "\nExplanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics identifies several conditions that any reasonable theory should satisfy, but shows they are mutually inconsistent. Critical-level views, which posit a threshold of well-being such that lives above it are worth living, lives at it are neutral, and below it are not, violate the Non-Elitism condition. Non-Elitism requires that a population with a larger number of people having moderate well-being should be preferred over a population with a smaller number of people having very high well-being, all else being equal. Critical-level views can violate this by preferring the smaller, highly well-off population when the larger population's well-being is only slightly above the critical level, thus favoring elitism by prioritizing quality over quantity in a way that contradicts the egalitarian spirit of Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C\nConfidence: 90%",

This group is generated by the homogeneous space \\(G_2/T\\), where \\(T\\) is the maximal torus of \\(G_2\\). The manifold \\(G_2/T\\) is 12-dimensional, Spin, and equipped with a non-trivial principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, making it represent a non-trivial class in the reduced bordism group. The torsion structure arises from the homotopy groups of \\(G_2\\), specifically \\(\\pi_6(G_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}\\), which influences the bordism computation.\n\nThe Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Spin bordism, with \\(E_2^{p,q} = H^p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}})\\), converges to \\(\\Omega_{p+q}^{\\text{Spin}}(BG_2)\\). The cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is \\(\\mathbb{Z}[p_1, e] / (e^2 = p_1^3)\\), where \\(p_1\\) is in degree 4 and \\(e\\) is in degree 6.

The only non-trivial element in the associated graded for the reduced bordism is in filtration degree 6, corresponding to \\(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}\\), generated by \\(G_2/T\\). The free parts in the spectral sequence vanish in the bordism group, leaving only the torsion part.\n\nThus, the reduced bordism group is \\(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n**Explanation:** The reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of \\(BG_2\\) is \\(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}\\), generated by the homogeneous space \\(G_2/T\\). This result is obtained from the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, where the cohomology of \\(BG_2\\) and Spin bordism groups of a point are used, and the differential analysis shows that only the torsion part survives in the reduced bordism group. The torsion structure is consistent with the homotopy groups of \\(G_2\\), particularly \\(\\pi_6(G_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\n**Confidence:** 95%",
