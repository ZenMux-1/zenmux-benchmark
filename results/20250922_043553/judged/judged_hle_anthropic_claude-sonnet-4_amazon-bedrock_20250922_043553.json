            "response": "I need to analyze Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem and determine which condition critical-level views violate.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that no population axiology can simultaneously satisfy all of several seemingly reasonable conditions. Critical-level views are a type of population ethics that evaluate the value of adding people to a population based on whether their welfare exceeds a certain critical level.\n\nLet me consider each condition:\n\nA. Egalitarian Dominance: This requires that a more equal distribution of welfare is better than a less equal one, holding total welfare constant.\n\nB. General Non-Extreme Priority: This condition limits how much priority can be given to worse-off individuals.\n\nC. Non-Elitism: This prevents giving disproportionate weight to a small elite group.\n\nD. Weak Non-Sadism: This condition roughly states that it's not better to add people with lives barely worth living to a population of people with very high welfare.\n\nE. Weak Quality Addition: This condition states that adding people with sufficiently high welfare to any population makes that population better.\n\nCritical-level views are specifically designed to avoid problems like the Repugnant Conclusion by setting a threshold (critical level) above which adding people is good and below which it's bad or neutral. The key issue with critical-level views is that they can violate Weak Quality Addition.\n\nHere's why: If the critical level is set above zero (which it typically is in critical-level views), then adding people with positive but below-critical-level welfare would not improve the population according to the critical-level view, even if their lives are worth living. This directly contradicts Weak Quality Addition, which says that adding people with sufficiently high welfare should always improve a population.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition because they can judge that adding people with positive welfare (but below the critical level) does not improve a population, contradicting the requirement that adding people with sufficiently high welfare should always make a population better.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",

GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) was introduced in a paper by Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel. The last author is Gimpel, which ends with 'l', so c3 = 'l'.\n\n4. Taking 'l' and applying ROT13: 'l' becomes 'y', so c4 = 'y'.\n\n5. Mars has a mass of about 6.39 \u00d7 10^23 kg, Earth has about 5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg, and the Moon has about 7.35 \u00d7 10^22 kg. Mars is closer in mass to Earth than to the Moon.
