            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's impossibility theorems in population ethics explore the challenges in creating a moral theory that satisfies several intuitive conditions simultaneously. Critical-level views, which introduce a threshold level of well-being that lives must exceed to be considered as adding positive value, often conflict with certain conditions. Specifically, they can violate the condition of \"Weak Quality Addition,\" which suggests that adding individuals with lives worth living should not make an outcome worse. Critical-level views can imply that adding lives below a certain threshold does not improve the situation, potentially violating this condition.\n\nAnswer: E. Weak Quality Addition\nConfidence: 85%",

The group \\( G_2 \\) is a compact, simply-connected, simple Lie group of rank 2, and its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) is a space that classifies principal \\( G_2 \\)-bundles.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism group \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is concerned with Spin manifolds of dimension 12 that admit a map to \\( BG_2 \\), modulo those that can be represented by manifolds with trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles. This is equivalent to considering the kernel of the map from the Spin bordism of \\( BG_2 \\) to the Spin bordism of a point, \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(pt)\\).\n\nThe computation of \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) involves understanding the homotopy groups of \\( BG_2 \\) and the action of the Steenrod algebra on its cohomology. The group \\( G_2 \\) has a non-trivial 3-dimensional representation, and its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) has non-trivial cohomology in degrees that are multiples of 4, due to the presence of characteristic classes like the Pontryagin classes.\n\nThe relevant cohomology groups and characteristic classes can be used to determine the bordism classes. In particular, the 12-dimensional Spin bordism group is influenced by the 4th and 8th Pontryagin classes, which are non-trivial in the cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\).\n\nThe reduced bordism group \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is typically computed using spectral sequences, such as the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which relates the cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\) to the Spin bordism groups. The differentials in this spectral sequence can be computed using the known structure of the Steenrod algebra and the cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\).\n\nFor \\( G_2 \\), the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group is known to be \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\). This result is due to the presence of a non-trivial 12-dimensional characteristic class that cannot be represented by a manifold with a trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundle.\n\nExplanation: The reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism of \\( BG_2 \\) is determined by the non-trivial characteristic classes in the cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\) and the structure of the Spin bordism groups. The result \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\) reflects the presence of a non-trivial class that cannot be represented by a trivial bundle.\nAnswer: \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\nConfidence: 90%",
