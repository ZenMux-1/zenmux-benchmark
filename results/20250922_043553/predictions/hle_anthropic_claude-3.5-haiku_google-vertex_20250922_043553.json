This appears to be a highly specialized query about a specific theorem in social choice theory or voting systems, likely related to Kenneth Arrow's work (not Arrhenius's). Without additional context or specific knowledge about the precise details of this theorem and critical-level views, I cannot determine which condition is being violated.\n\nExplanation: The question references a specific theorem and theoretical concept that requires specialized knowledge in social choice theory.
