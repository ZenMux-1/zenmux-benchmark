            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem states that no moral view can satisfy all of the following conditions: Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition. Critical-level views, which prioritize improving the lives of those below a certain threshold, violate General Non-Extreme Priority. This is because critical-level views give extreme priority to those below the threshold, potentially at the expense of improving the lives of those above the threshold.\n\nAnswer: B\nConfidence: 100%\n",

In this case, we are looking at $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$.\n\nThe Spin bordism groups are known. We have $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt) = \\mathbb{Z}$. The reduced bordism group $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$ consists of bordism classes that are not detected by the map to $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt)$.\n\nThe classifying space $BG_2$ has a non-trivial fundamental group. The Spin bordism of $BG_2$ is related to the Spin bordism of a point. The reduced Spin bordism of $BG_2$ is the kernel of the map $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt)$. Since we are looking for the reduced bordism, we are looking for elements that are not detected by the map to $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt)$.\n\nThe Spin bordism groups are known to be torsion-free. The 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of a point is $\\mathbb{Z}$. The reduced bordism group is the kernel of the map to $\\mathbb{Z}$. Since we are looking for the reduced bordism, we are looking for elements that are not detected by the map to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism of $BG_2$ is zero because the Spin bordism of a point is $\\mathbb{Z}$, and we are looking for the kernel of the map to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAnswer: 0\nConfidence: 80%\n",
