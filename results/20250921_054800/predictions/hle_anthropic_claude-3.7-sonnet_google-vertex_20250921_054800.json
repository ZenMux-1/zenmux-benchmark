            "response": "I need to analyze which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views in population ethics.\n\nCritical-level views hold that adding a new life is morally good only if that life has a welfare level above some critical level (which is positive). This means that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare might be considered negative.\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- Egalitarian Dominance relates to preferring more equal distributions\n- General Non-Extreme Priority concerns not giving extreme priority to the worst-off\n- Non-Elitism states we shouldn't prefer a smaller population with slightly higher welfare over a larger population with slightly lower welfare\n- Weak Non-Sadism states that adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make things worse\n- Weak Quality Addition concerns adding lives with very high welfare\n\nCritical-level views specifically violate Weak Non-Sadism because they imply that adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare can make a population worse. This directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism condition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare should never make a population worse.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views in population ethics hold that adding a new life is only good if that life has welfare above some positive critical level. This means adding lives with positive but below-critical welfare can make a population worse. This directly violates the Weak Non-Sadism condition, which states that adding lives with positive welfare should never make a population worse.\n\nAnswer: D. Weak Non-Sadism\n\nConfidence: 90%",

            "response": "I need to compute the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of the classifying space of G2. This is a highly specialized question in algebraic topology.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism group of BG2 in dimension 12 is denoted as \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2). To compute this, I need to consider Spin manifolds of dimension 12 with G2 principal bundles, modulo those with trivial G2 bundles.\n\nFor such specialized computations, I would typically use spectral sequence methods. The Adams spectral sequence or the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence would be appropriate tools.\n\nFrom the literature, it's known that:\n- The Spin bordism groups \u03a9^Spin_* are computed up to dimension 16\n- For G2, which is a compact, simple, simply-connected Lie group of rank 2, the cohomology of BG2 has specific generators\n\nHowever, I don't have the complete computation for this specific reduced bordism group. The full computation would require detailed knowledge of the differentials in the spectral sequence and the extension problems.\n\nExplanation: This question requires specialized knowledge in algebraic topology that goes beyond my current capabilities. A complete answer would require detailed computations using spectral sequences and knowledge of specific results about G2 and Spin bordism that I don't have access to. This is an active research-level question in algebraic topology.\n\nAnswer: I cannot provide the specific computation of \u03a9\u0303^Spin_12(BG2).\n\nConfidence: 90% (that this question requires specialized research-level knowledge beyond my current capabilities)",
