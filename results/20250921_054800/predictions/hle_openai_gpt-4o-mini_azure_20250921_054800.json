            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem deals with the aggregation of individual preferences into a collective decision. Critical-level views typically violate the condition of \"Egalitarian Dominance,\" which states that if one alternative is preferred by all individuals over another, then the collective preference should reflect that. Critical-level views can lead to situations where a less preferred option is chosen due to the way thresholds are set, thus undermining the principle of egalitarian dominance.\n\nAnswer: A. Egalitarian Dominance  \nConfidence: 85%",

The classifying space BG2 is a space that classifies principal G2-bundles, and it has a well-known relationship with the topology of G2. The reduced bordism groups are concerned with the classes of manifolds that can be represented by manifolds with non-trivial G2 bundles. The reduced bordism group in this case can be computed using the fact that G2 is a 14-dimensional group, and its classifying space BG2 has a specific cohomology ring structure. The reduced bordism group in dimension 12 is related to the cohomology of the classifying space, which can be computed using spectral sequences or other algebraic topology tools. \n\nAnswer: 0 (the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of BG2 is trivial)\nConfidence: 85%",
