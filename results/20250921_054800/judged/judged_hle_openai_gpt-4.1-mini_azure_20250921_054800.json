Critical-level views are a type of population axiology that assign a \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding individuals with welfare below this level decreases overall value, and above which adding individuals increases overall value. This approach violates the condition of Non-Elitism, which states that the social welfare function should not give absolute priority to a subset of individuals (i.e., it should not be elitist). Critical-level views can be seen as violating Non-Elitism because they effectively set a threshold that excludes individuals below the critical level from positively contributing to social welfare, thus giving priority to those above the threshold.\n\nAnswer: C.

The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- \\(G_2\\) is a compact, simply connected, exceptional Lie group of dimension 14.\n- \\(BG_2\\) is its classifying space.\n- We want \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\), the reduced Spin bordism group in dimension 12.\n\n**Step 2: Known facts about Spin bordism**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) are known and have been computed by Anderson-Brown-Peterson.\n- In low dimensions, \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\).\n- The free part is generated by products of quaternionic projective planes and other known manifolds.\n- The torsion part is \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\).\n\n**Step 3: Use the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)**\n\nThe AHSS for Spin bordism of \\(BG_2\\) has:\n\n\\[\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n\\]\n\nWe want total degree 12, so \\(p+q=12\\).\n\n**Step 4: Cohomology of \\(BG_2\\)**\n\n- \\(G_2\\) is simply connected and compact.\n- The integral cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is known to be a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n\n\\[\nH^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}],\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) are generators in degrees 4 and 12 respectively.\n\n- By universal coefficients, \\(H_p(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is torsion-free and concentrated in degrees multiples of 4 (since the cohomology is polynomial on even degree generators).\n\n**Step 5: Compute \\(E^2\\)-page terms with \\(p+q=12\\)**\n\nWe consider all pairs \\((p,q)\\) with \\(p+q=12\\):\n\n- \\(p=0, q=12\\): \\(H_0(BG_2;

The main uncertainty is in the differentials of the AHSS, but given the torsion-free nature of \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) and the known structure of \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\), this is a well-supported conclusion.)",
