            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views in population ethics posit that adding a life is only good if that life is above a certain \"critical level\" of well-being. This means that adding lives below this level does not make an outcome better, and may even be neutral or worse. Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that no population axiology can satisfy all of a set of plausible conditions simultaneously. Critical-level views are known to violate the \"General Non-Extreme Priority\" condition, which requires that, for any two populations, if one is much better off than the other, then the better-off population should be ranked higher, regardless of the number of people at the critical level. Critical-level views can rank a population with many people at the critical level as equally good as a population with fewer people at a much higher level, thus violating General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\nAnswer: B.

The unreduced group \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) fits into an exact sequence:\n\\[\n0 \\to \\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(\\text{pt}) \\to 0\n\\]\nwhere the last map is induced by forgetting the \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\nThe reduced group is the kernel of the map to \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(\\text{pt})\\), i.e., it consists of bordism classes that cannot be represented by manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\nFor compact, connected, simply-connected Lie groups like \\(G_2\\), the computation of \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) can be approached via the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS):\n\\[\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_q(\\text{pt})) \\implies \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{p+q}(BG_2)\n\\]\nThe cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is known: it is a polynomial ring generated by classes in degrees 4 and 8. The relevant Spin bordism groups for low degrees are:\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_0 = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_4 = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_8 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nThe reduced group is generated by bordism classes with nontrivial \\(G_2\\)-bundles, i.e., by the image of the AHSS terms with positive \\(p\\).\n\nThe only nontrivial cohomology in degrees up to 12 are in degrees 4, 8, and 12, so the possible contributions are:\n- \\(H_4(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_8)\\)\n- \\(H_8(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_4)\\)\n- \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_0)\\)\n\nBut \\(H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nSo, the reduced group is:\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\cong H_4(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_8) \\oplus H_8(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_4) \\oplus H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_0)\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n- \\(H_4(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_8) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(H_8(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_4) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_0) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nSo, the reduced group is \\(\\mathbb{Z}^4\\).\n\nHowever, there may be differentials in the AHSS, but for simply-connected Lie groups and Spin bordism, in degree 12, these differentials vanish (see e.g. Wang, Wen, and Witten, \"A New SU(2) Anomaly and Topological Invariants in 4d, 5d, and 6d\", arXiv:1810.00844, and references therein).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^4\n\\]\n\nAnswer: \\(\\mathbb{Z}^4\\)\nConfidence: 90%",
