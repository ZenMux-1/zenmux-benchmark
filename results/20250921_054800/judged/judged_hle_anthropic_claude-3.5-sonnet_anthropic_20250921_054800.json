This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above some critical level should make a population better, all else being equal. Critical-level views posit that there is some positive welfare level above zero below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives have positive welfare. This directly conflicts with the Weak Quality Addition condition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare (above a certain threshold) should be an improvement.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",
