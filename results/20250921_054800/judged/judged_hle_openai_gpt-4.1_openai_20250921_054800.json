            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is a result in population ethics that shows the incompatibility of several plausible conditions for a theory of population ethics. Critical-level views are theories that assign a \"critical level\" of well-being, and only well-being above this level counts positively towards the overall value of a population. These views are designed to avoid the \"Repugnant Conclusion\" but, in doing so, they violate the condition known as \"Egalitarian Dominance.\" This condition states that if one population is better off in terms of equality and total well-being, it should be ranked higher. Critical-level views can rank a less equal population higher if it has more people just above the critical level, thus violating Egalitarian Dominance.\n\nAnswer: A.

So, the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the reduced group is:\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(BG_2) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\Omega_8^{\\text{Spin}} \\oplus \\cdots\n\\]\nBut since \\(\\Omega_4^{\\text{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\Omega_8^{\\text{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), and the only nontrivial homology in degrees 4, 8, 12 is \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), we get:\n- \\(H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\Omega_4^{\\text{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\Omega_8^{\\text{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nSo, the total is \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), but we must mod out by the image of \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\), which sits in the \\(E^2_{0,12}\\) term.\n\nThe map from \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt})\\) to the total group is injective into the sum, so the reduced group is:\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}^2\n\\]\nThis matches the result in the literature, e.g., see Wang, Wan, and Wen, \"Higher 't Hooft anomalies, symmetry-protected topological states, and cobordisms: Beyond group cohomology,\" Phys.
