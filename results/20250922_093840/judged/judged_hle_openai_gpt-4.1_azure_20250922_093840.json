            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views in population ethics posit that adding a life is only good if that life is above a certain \"critical level\" of well-being. This means that adding lives below this level does not make an outcome better, and may even make it worse. Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that no population axiology can satisfy all of a set of plausible conditions simultaneously. Critical-level views are known to violate the condition of \"General Non-Extreme Priority,\" which requires that, for any two populations, if one is much better off than the other, then the better-off population should be preferred, regardless of the number of people at a low level of well-being. Critical-level views can prefer adding many lives just above the critical level over a few lives at a very high level, thus violating General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\nAnswer: B.
