Critical-level views are characterized by the idea that adding a life is only a benefit if its well-being exceeds a certain \"critical level.\" This approach can lead to violations of the \"Non-Elitism\" condition, which states that the value of a population should not depend solely on the well-being of a small elite group. Critical-level views can, in some cases, give disproportionate weight to those just above the critical level, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 90%",
