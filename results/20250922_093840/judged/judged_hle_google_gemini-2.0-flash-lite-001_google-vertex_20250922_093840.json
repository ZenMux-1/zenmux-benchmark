Critical-level views, which prioritize bringing individuals to a certain quality of life level, violate General Non-Extreme Priority. This is because critical-level views give extreme priority to those below the critical level, potentially at the expense of those above it.\n\nAnswer: B\nConfidence: 100%\n",

In other words, it consists of bordism classes that map to zero in the Spin bordism of a point.
