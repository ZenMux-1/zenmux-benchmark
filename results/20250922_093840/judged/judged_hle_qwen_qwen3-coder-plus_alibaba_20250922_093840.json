            "response": "I need to analyze Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem and identify which condition critical-level views violate.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem states. This theorem shows that several plausible conditions for population ethics are incompatible. The conditions typically include:\n\n1. Egalitarian Dominance - If population A is more equal than population B, and nobody is worse off in A than in B, then A is better than B\n2. General Non-Extreme Priority - Benefits to the worse off matter more, but not infinitely more\n3. Non-Elitism - Adding lives with welfare slightly above the critical level should not make a population better\n4. Weak Non-Sadism - Adding lives with positive welfare shouldn't make a population worse\n5. Weak Quality Addition - Adding sufficiently good lives makes a population better\n\nCritical-level views hold that there's a specific welfare level (the \"critical level\") such that:\n- Adding lives above this level improves the population\n- Adding lives below this level worsens the population\n- Adding lives at exactly this level leaves the population unchanged\n\nNow, let me examine which condition critical-level views violate:\n\nLooking at Non-Elitism: This condition states that adding lives with welfare slightly above the critical level should not make a population better. However, critical-level views explicitly say that adding lives above the critical level DOES make the population better.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction. Critical-level views violate Non-Elitism because they hold that even small amounts of welfare above the critical level have positive value, while Non-Elitism says such additions shouldn't improve the population.\n\nThe other conditions don't have this direct conflict with critical-level views.\n\nExplanation: Critical-level views violate Non-Elitism because they maintain that adding lives with welfare above the critical level improves the population, while Non-Elitism requires that adding lives with welfare only slightly above the critical level should not make the population better. This creates a direct contradiction between the core principle of critical-level views and the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism\n\nConfidence: 85%",
