            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should make a population better. Critical-level views posit that adding lives is only good if they exceed some critical level of welfare, which can lead to situations where adding lives with positive (but below critical-level) welfare makes a population worse, directly contradicting the Weak Quality Addition condition.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 90%",
