            "response": "\nExplanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that critical-level views in population ethics violate the Weak Quality Addition condition. Critical-level views posit that there exists a threshold level of well-being such that adding a person with well below this threshold (even if their life is worth living) does not improve the overall value of a population, and may even worsen it. This directly contradicts Weak Quality Addition, which states that adding a person with positive well-being should make a population better, all else being equal. When the critical level is set above zero, critical-level views violate this condition because they do not recognize the addition of a positively well-off individual (but below the critical level) as improving the population.\n\nAnswer: E\nConfidence: 90%",

This group is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nThe generator of this group is represented by the manifold \\(K3 \\times S^8\\), where \\(K3\\) is the K3 surface (a 4-dimensional Spin manifold) and \\(S^8\\) is the 8-sphere (a Spin manifold). The principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle over \\(K3 \\times S^8\\) is pulled back from a non-trivial bundle over \\(K3\\) with characteristic class \\(c_4 = 1\\) in \\(H^4(K3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\). The characteristic class on \\(K3 \\times S^8\\) is non-trivial, and this pair generates the \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) summand in the reduced bordism group.\n\nThe trivial bundle classes correspond to pairs where the characteristic class is zero, and these are identified with the image of the ordinary Spin bordism group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}\\) in the bordism group of \\(BG_2\\). Since \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}\\) and the generator of the reduced group has infinite order, the quotient yields \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nThus, the reduced bordism group is \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nExplanation: The reduced bordism group is computed as the quotient of the Spin bordism group of \\(BG_2\\) by the image of the Spin bordism group of a point. The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), generated by the pair \\((K3 \\times S^8, c)\\) with non-trivial characteristic class \\(c\\). The image of \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}\\) is torsion (isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}\\)), so the quotient is \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nConfidence: 80%",
