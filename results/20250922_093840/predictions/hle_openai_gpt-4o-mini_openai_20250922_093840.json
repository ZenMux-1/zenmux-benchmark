            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem addresses the challenges in aggregating individual preferences into a collective decision while satisfying certain fairness conditions. Critical-level views typically violate the condition of \"Egalitarian Dominance,\" which states that if one alternative is preferred by all individuals over another, then the collective preference should reflect that. Critical-level views can lead to situations where a less preferred option is chosen due to the way thresholds are set, thus undermining the egalitarian principle. \n\nAnswer: A.

It has a rich geometric structure and is closely related to the theory of special holonomy.\n\n2. **Classifying Space \\( BG_2 \\)**: The classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) serves as a space where principal \\( G_2 \\) bundles can be classified. The homotopy type of \\( BG_2 \\) is important for understanding the associated characteristic classes and bordism groups.\n\n3. **Spin Bordism**: Spin bordism is a type of bordism that takes into account the additional structure of a Spin manifold, which is a manifold that has a Spin structure (essentially a lift of the frame bundle to a double cover). The reduced bordism groups, denoted \\( \\tilde{M}_n^{Spin} \\), focus on classes of manifolds that can be represented by manifolds with non-trivial Spin structures.\n\n4. **Computing \\( \\tilde{M}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\)**: The reduced Spin bordism group \\( \\tilde{M}_n^{Spin} \\) can be computed using the properties of the classifying space. For \\( G_2 \\), we can use the fact that the cohomology ring \\( H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is known, and we can relate it to the bordism groups.\n\n5. **Characteristic Classes**: The characteristic classes associated with \\( G_2 \\) can be computed, and they will play a role in determining the reduced bordism. The relevant characteristic classes for Spin manifolds are the Stiefel-Whitney classes and the Pontryagin classes.\n\n6. **Final Computation**: The reduced Spin bordism group \\( \\tilde{M}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\) can be computed using the universal coefficient theorem and the known results about the cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\). The result is that \\( \\tilde{M}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\), reflecting the presence of non-trivial Spin structures in dimension 12.\n\nIn conclusion, the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of the classifying space of the Lie group \\( G_2 \\) is:\n\nExplanation: The computation of reduced Spin bordism involves understanding the properties of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) and its relation to Spin structures. The result is derived from the known cohomology and characteristic classes associated with \\( G_2 \\).\nAnswer: \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\)\nConfidence: 85%",
