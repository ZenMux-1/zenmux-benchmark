This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above some critical level should make a population better. Critical-level views hold that there is some positive welfare level above zero below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives have positive welfare. This directly contradicts the Weak Quality Addition condition, which requires that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should improve the overall situation.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 90%",
