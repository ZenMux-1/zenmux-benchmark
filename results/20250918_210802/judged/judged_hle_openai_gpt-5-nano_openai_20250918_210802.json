The reduced Spin bordism \u03a9_*^Spin(BG2)red is \u03c0_*(MSpin \u2227 BG2_+) reduced at the basepoint. There is a Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS)\nE2^{p,q} = H_p(BG2; \u03a9_q^Spin(pt)) \u21d2 \u03a9_{p+q}^Spin(BG2).\n\nFor n = 12 the only p that can contribute (given H^*(BG2; Z) is a polynomial algebra in classes in degrees 4 and 12, so H_p(BG2) is nonzero only for p = 0, 4, 12 in the range relevant to total degree 12) are:\n- p = 0, q = 12: E2^{0,12} \u2245 \u03a9_12^Spin(pt)\n- p = 4, q = 8: E2^{4,8} \u2245 H_4(BG2) \u2297 \u03a9_8^Spin(pt) \u2245 \u03a9_8^Spin(pt)\n- p = 12, q = 0: E2^{12,0} \u2245 H_12(BG2) \u2297 \u03a9_0^Spin(pt) \u2245 \u03a9_0^Spin(pt)\n\nThus, on the E2-page we have contributions from \u03a9_12^Spin(pt), \u03a9_8^Spin(pt), and \u03a9_0^Spin(pt). The reduced group is the kernel of the natural map \u03a9_{12}^Spin(BG2) \u2192 \u03a9_{12}^Spin(pt) induced by collapsing BG2 to a point; in terms of the AHSS this amounts to discarding the p = 0 piece, so\n\u03a9_{12}^Spin(BG2)red \u2245 \u03a9_8^Spin(pt) \u2295 \u03a9_0^Spin(pt),\nprovided there are no nontrivial differentials affecting these entries (and no extensions that mix p > 0 pieces with p = 0). Since H_p(BG2) is zero for p in other positive degrees in this range and the relevant low-dimensional Spin bordism groups are well-known, the differentials do not obstruct this splitting in degree 12. Consequently, the reduced group is the direct sum of the p > 0 pieces.\n\nKnown low-dimensional Spin bordism groups:\n- \u03a9_0^Spin(pt) \u2245 Z\n- \u03a9_8^Spin(pt) \u2245 Z",
