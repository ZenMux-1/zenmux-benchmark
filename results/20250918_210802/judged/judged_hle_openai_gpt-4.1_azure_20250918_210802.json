This means that only lives above a certain threshold count positively, which can lead to situations where the interests of a small group (those above the critical level) dominate the evaluation, potentially ignoring the interests of others. This violates the condition of \"Non-Elitism,\" which requires that no particular group\u2019s interests should dominate the assessment. Non-Elitism is specifically designed to prevent such \"elitist\" outcomes, making it the condition that critical-level views violate.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism\nConfidence: 95%",
