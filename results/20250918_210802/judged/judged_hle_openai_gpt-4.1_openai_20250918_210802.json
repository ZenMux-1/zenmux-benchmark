These views are often said to violate the condition of Non-Elitism, which is Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem condition. Non-Elitism requires that the value of a population should not depend solely on the well-being of a small elite group, but critical-level views can make the value of a population depend on whether individuals' well-being exceeds the critical level, which can be seen as an elitist feature.\n\nAnswer: C.
