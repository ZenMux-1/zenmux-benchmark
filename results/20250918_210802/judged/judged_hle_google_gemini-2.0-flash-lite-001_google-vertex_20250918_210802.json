Critical-level views, which posit a critical level of well-being below which existence is negative, violate the condition of Weak Quality Addition. This condition states that adding a life with positive well-being to a population should make the population better off, regardless of the existing population's well-being. Critical-level views, however, may consider adding a life with positive well-being to a population with well-being below the critical level as making the population worse off.\n\nAnswer: E\nConfidence: 100%\n",

In other words, it consists of bordism classes that map to zero in the Spin bordism of a point.

The trivial principal $G_2$ bundle corresponds to the trivial class in the bordism group.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism of $BG_2$ is related to the characteristic numbers of the $G_2$ bundles.
