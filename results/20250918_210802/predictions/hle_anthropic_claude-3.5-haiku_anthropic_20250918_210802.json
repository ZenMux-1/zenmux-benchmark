            "response": "Let me carefully analyze this question:\n\nExplanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem deals with challenges in social choice theory and voting systems. The theorem explores conditions that cannot simultaneously be satisfied in certain voting or social welfare aggregation scenarios. To determine which specific condition critical-level views violate, I'll need to recall the specific characteristics of critical-level views and the theorem's conditions.\n\nCritical-level views typically involve comparing welfare levels against some predetermined critical threshold, which can create unique challenges in welfare aggregation. Based on my understanding, critical-level views are most likely to violate the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nNon-Elitism essentially requires that the social welfare ranking cannot be determined solely by the preferences of a small subset of individuals. Critical-level views, by introducing a threshold-based evaluation, can potentially allow a small group's perspective to disproportionately influence overall social welfare assessment.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism\n\nConfidence: 75%\n\nMy confidence is reasonably high but not absolute, as the precise details of Arrhenius's theorem require careful mathematical specification. While I'm confident in my reasoning about critical-level views and Non-Elitism, there's always a possibility of nuanced technical details I might not fully capture.",

Without extensive calculations, I cannot confidently provide the exact value.\n\nThe most responsible approach is to acknowledge the complexity and state that a precise computation would require advanced spectral sequence techniques and detailed knowledge of G2's homotopy and characteristic classes.\n\nAnswer: Insufficient information to definitively compute\n\nConfidence: 30%\n\nThe low confidence reflects the technical complexity of the problem and the need for specialized algebraic topology techniques beyond a straightforward calculation.",
