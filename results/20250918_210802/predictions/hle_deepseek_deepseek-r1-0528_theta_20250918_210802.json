            "response": "**Explanation:**  \nCritical-level views hold that adding a person to a population is beneficial only if their welfare exceeds a fixed \"critical level\" (typically above neutrality). This directly violates **Weak Quality Addition**, which requires that adding lives with positive welfare (above neutrality) is considered good, provided no existing lives are affected. Critical-level views reject this, as they deem additions below the critical level (even if above zero) as bad. The other conditions are less directly impacted:  \n- **A (Egalitarian Dominance)** is generally satisfied.  \n- **B (General Non-Extreme Priority)** and **C (Non-Elitism)** are not core violations.  \n- **D (Weak Non-Sadism)** is typically satisfied, as critical-level views avoid adding negative-welfare lives.  \n\n**Answer:** E  \n**Confidence:** 95%",

The last author's last name is \"Gimpel,\" which ends with the letter \"l.\"\n- **c4**: Applying Rot13 to \"l\" (c3) results in \"y\" (since \"l\" is the 12th letter, 12 + 13 = 25, which corresponds to \"y\").\n- **c5**: Mars has a mass of approximately \\(6.39 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg, Earth has \\(5.97 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, and the Moon has \\(7.34 \\times 10^{22}\\) kg.
