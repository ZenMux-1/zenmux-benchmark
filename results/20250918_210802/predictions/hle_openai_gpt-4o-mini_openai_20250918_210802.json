            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem addresses the challenges in aggregating individual preferences into a collective decision while satisfying certain fairness conditions. Critical-level views typically violate the condition of \"Egalitarian Dominance,\" which states that if one alternative is preferred by a majority over another, then the collective preference should reflect that majority preference. Critical-level views can lead to situations where the preferences of a minority can override the majority, thus violating this egalitarian principle.\n\nAnswer: A.

Its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) is a space that classifies principal \\( G_2 \\)-bundles. The homotopy type of \\( BG_2 \\) is important for understanding its bordism properties.\n\n2. **Spin Bordism**: Spin bordism is a type of bordism that takes into account the additional structure of a Spin manifold. The reduced Spin bordism, denoted \\( \\tilde{MSO}^n \\), focuses on classes of manifolds that can be represented by Spin manifolds, ignoring those that can be represented by manifolds with trivial principal bundles.\n\n3. **Homotopy Groups**: The reduced Spin bordism groups \\( \\tilde{MSO}^n \\) can be computed using the homotopy groups of the classifying space. For \\( G_2 \\), we can use the fact that \\( BG_2 \\) has a known homotopy type, and we can compute the relevant homotopy groups.\n\n4. **Bordism Classes**: The reduced bordism classes in dimension 12 will be influenced by the structure of \\( BG_2 \\) and the properties of Spin manifolds. The reduced bordism group \\( \\tilde{MSO}^{12} \\) can be computed using the universal coefficient theorem and the known results about the homotopy groups of \\( BG_2 \\).\n\n5. **Final Computation**: The reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of \\( BG_2 \\) can be computed to be isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\). This is due to the fact that the relevant homotopy groups and the structure of \\( G_2 \\) lead to this conclusion.\n\nIn summary, the reduced 12-th dimensional Spin bordism of the classifying space of the Lie group \\( G_2 \\) is:\n\nExplanation: The computation is based on the properties of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) and the structure of Spin bordism, leading to the conclusion that the reduced bordism group in this dimension is \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\).\nAnswer: \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\)\nConfidence: 85%",
