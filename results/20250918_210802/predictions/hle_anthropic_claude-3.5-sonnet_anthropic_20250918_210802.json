            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above some critical level should make a population better, all else being equal. Critical-level views posit that there is some positive welfare level above zero below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives are worth living. This directly conflicts with the Weak Quality Addition condition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare (even if below some arbitrary threshold) should be an improvement.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 85%",

The reduced Spin bordism groups of BG2 in dimension 12 would require advanced computational techniques including spectral sequences and characteristic classes. However, this specific computation has been done in the literature.\n\nThe reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of BG2 is known to be Z/3Z. This result comes from analyzing the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Spin bordism of BG2, and considering the contribution of characteristic classes. The Z/3Z structure arises from specific G2 characteristic classes in dimension 12.\n\nHowever, given the extreme technical nature of this computation and the multiple sophisticated tools required, I'm not entirely confident in providing this answer without being able to walk through the full computation step-by-step.\n\nAnswer: Z/3Z\n\nConfidence: 75%\n\nThe confidence is not 100% because while I believe this is the correct answer based on literature results, the computation is extremely complex and involves multiple sophisticated mathematical tools that could lead to potential misunderstandings.",
