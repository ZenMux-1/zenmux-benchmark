Critical-level views, which posit a threshold level of well-being where adding lives below it is neutral or worse, violate Weak Quality Addition. This condition requires that if adding a life of a certain quality improves a population, adding a higher-quality life should also improve it in a comparable or stronger way, which critical-level views do not uphold due to their threshold-based prioritization.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 95%",
