            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is a result in population ethics that shows the incompatibility of several plausible conditions for a theory of population ethics. Critical-level views are theories that assign value to lives only above a certain \"critical level\" of well-being. These views are often said to violate the condition of \"Non-Elitism,\" which states that the value of a population should not depend only on the well-being of a subset of individuals (e.g., those above the critical level), but should take into account everyone's well-being. Critical-level views, by focusing on well-being above a threshold, effectively ignore the well-being of those below the critical level, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\nAnswer: C.
