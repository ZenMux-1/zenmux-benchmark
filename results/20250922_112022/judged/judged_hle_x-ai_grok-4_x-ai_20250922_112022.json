This means they violate conditions that prohibit sadistic implications, specifically Weak Non-Sadism. The other conditions are satisfied by critical-level views in the context of the sixth theorem, which demonstrates the impossibility of satisfying all listed intuitive principles simultaneously.\nAnswer: D\nConfidence: 90%",
