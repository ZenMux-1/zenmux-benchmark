That contradicts Weak Quality Addition, which requires that adding an individual with positive welfare (and no effects on others) increases overall value. Thus critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition.\n\nAnswer: E. Weak Quality Addition\nConfidence: 85%",

Rationally H*(BG2;Q) = Q[x4,x12] so there are nontrivial input groups in the AHSS coming from H12, H8, H4 and H0 with the MSpin-coefficient groups in degrees 0,4,8,12. Working through the low-degree MSpin-coefficients and the AHSS differentials (the standard low-degree values of MSpin_* and the fact that the only possible nontrivial differentials in total degree 12 come from low torsion classes) one finds the only surviving nontrivial free summands in total degree 12 come from the H12 and H8\u2297MSpin4 pieces and these produce two independent Z-summands; all torsion classes are killed by differentials. Hence the reduced Spin-bordism group in degree 12 is free of rank two.\n\nAnswer: \\tilde\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \u2245 Z \u2295 Z\n\nConfidence: 20%",
