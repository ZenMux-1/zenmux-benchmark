Critical-level views, which introduce a threshold level of well-being that lives must exceed to contribute positively to overall value, often conflict with certain conditions in these theorems. The condition that critical-level views typically violate is \"Non-Elitism.\" Non-Elitism is the idea that no particular level of well-being should be given absolute priority over others, which is at odds with the critical-level approach that sets a specific threshold.\n\nAnswer: C.

The group \\( G_2 \\) is one of the exceptional Lie groups, and its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) is a space that classifies principal \\( G_2 \\)-bundles. The \"reduced\" bordism means we are interested in bordism classes that cannot be represented by manifolds with trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles.\n\nThe Spin bordism group \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_n(X)\\) for a space \\(X\\) is the group of equivalence classes of \\(n\\)-dimensional Spin manifolds with a map to \\(X\\), where two such manifolds are equivalent if there is a Spin cobordism between them that respects the maps to \\(X\\).\n\nFor the specific case of \\(BG_2\\), we are interested in \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\). The reduced bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(\\text{pt})\\), where \\(\\text{pt}\\) denotes a point. This map sends a bordism class to the class of the underlying manifold, ignoring the \\(G_2\\)-bundle structure.\n\nThe computation of such bordism groups often involves understanding the homotopy groups of the classifying space and the characteristic classes of the group. For \\(G_2\\), the relevant characteristic classes are related to the Pontryagin classes and the Euler class. The structure of the bordism group can be influenced by the topology of \\(BG_2\\) and the specific dimensions in which characteristic classes can be nontrivial.\n\nIn this case, the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of \\(BG_2\\) is known to be \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\). This result is due to the presence of a nontrivial characteristic class in dimension 12 that can be detected in the Spin bordism group.\n\nAnswer: \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\)\nConfidence: 90%",
