            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views in population ethics violate the Non-Elitism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. Non-Elitism requires that for any individual with high welfare, there exists a sufficient number of individuals with lower positive welfare such that adding the larger group is better than adding the single high-welfare individual. Critical-level views, however, prioritize individuals above a fixed \"critical level\" of welfare. This allows scenarios where adding one person *above* the critical level is deemed better than adding a vast number of people *below* the critical level (even if their welfare is still positive), directly contradicting Non-Elitism. The other conditions (Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Weak Non-Sadism, Weak Quality Addition) are either compatible with critical-level views or not directly violated by them.\n\nAnswer: C  \nConfidence: 95%",

The homology of \\(BG_2\\) is well-established as free in degrees 4, 8, and 12, and the Spin bordism groups of a point are known. The absence of differentials is due to the vanishing of target groups, but there is a small possibility of undetected higher differentials or torsion not captured, though the groups involved are free.
