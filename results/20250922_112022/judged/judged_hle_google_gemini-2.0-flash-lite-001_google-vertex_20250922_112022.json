Critical-level views, which prioritize bringing individuals to a certain quality of life level, violate General Non-Extreme Priority. This is because critical-level views give extreme priority to those below the critical level, potentially at the expense of those above it.\n\nAnswer: B\nConfidence: 100%\n",

In other words, it consists of bordism classes that map to zero in the Spin bordism of a point. For the classifying space of $G_2$, denoted by $BG_2$, we are looking for $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$.\n\nThe Spin bordism groups are known. We have $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt) = \\mathbb{Z}$.

The trivial principal $G_2$ bundle corresponds to the trivial class in the bordism group.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism of $BG_2$ is related to the characteristic numbers of the $G_2$ bundles.
