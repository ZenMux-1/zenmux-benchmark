            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views in population ethics set a threshold (the \"critical level\") such that adding a life is only considered to make an outcome better if that life is above the critical level of well-being. This means that adding lives with well-being below the critical level does not improve the outcome, and sometimes is considered neutral. Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem identifies conditions that cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. The condition that critical-level views violate is \"General Non-Extreme Priority,\" which requires that, for any two populations, if one population is much better off than the other, then the better-off population should be preferred, regardless of the number of people at the lower level. Critical-level views can violate this by not preferring a population with many people just above the critical level to one with fewer people at a much higher level, because the added lives do not count as improvements unless they are above the critical level.\n\nAnswer: B.
