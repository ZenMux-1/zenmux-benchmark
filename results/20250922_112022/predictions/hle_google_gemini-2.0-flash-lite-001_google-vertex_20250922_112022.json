            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem states that no moral view can satisfy all of the following conditions: Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition. Critical-level views, which prioritize bringing individuals to a certain quality of life level, violate General Non-Extreme Priority. This is because critical-level views give extreme priority to those below the critical level, potentially at the expense of those above it.\n\nAnswer: B\nConfidence: 100%\n",

In other words, it consists of bordism classes that map to zero in the Spin bordism of a point. For the classifying space of $G_2$, denoted by $BG_2$, we are looking for $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$.\n\nThe Spin bordism groups are known. We have $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt) = \\mathbb{Z}$. The reduced bordism group $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$ is the kernel of the map $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\to \\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt)$. Since we are considering the reduced bordism, we are looking for classes that are \"trivial\" in the sense that they can be represented by manifolds with trivial principal $G_2$ bundle.\n\nThe structure of the Spin bordism groups is well-understood. The 12th Spin bordism group of a point is $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt) = \\mathbb{Z}$.

The trivial principal $G_2$ bundle corresponds to the trivial class in the bordism group.\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism of $BG_2$ is related to the characteristic numbers of the $G_2$ bundles. Since we are looking for the reduced bordism, we are looking for classes that are trivial.
