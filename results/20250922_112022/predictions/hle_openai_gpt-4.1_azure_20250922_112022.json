            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views in population ethics set a threshold (the \"critical level\") such that adding a life is only considered to make an outcome better if that life is above the critical level of well-being. This means that adding lives with well-being below the critical level does not improve the outcome, and sometimes is considered neutral. Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem identifies conditions that cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. The condition that critical-level views violate is \"General Non-Extreme Priority,\" which requires that, for any two populations, if one population is much better off than the other, then the better-off population should be preferred, regardless of the number of people at the lower level. Critical-level views can violate this by not preferring a population with many people just above the critical level to one with fewer people at a much higher level, because the added lives do not count as improvements unless they are above the critical level.\n\nAnswer: B.

Its reciprocal/inverse concept is \"logical breadth\" or more commonly, \"logical shallowness.\" However, Charles Bennett is associated with \"logical depth\" and its inverse is \"logical shallowness\" (sometimes called \"triviality\" or \"simplicity\").

The \"reduced\" bordism group means we consider only those bordism classes that cannot be represented by manifolds with trivial principal \\(G_2\\)-bundle, i.e., we quotient out the image of the map from \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(\\text{pt})\\) to \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\).\n\nFor compact, simple Lie groups like \\(G_2\\), the Spin bordism groups of their classifying spaces have been studied in the literature, notably in works by Gilkey, Teichner, and more recently in the context of symmetry-protected topological phases (see e.g. Wang, Wen, and others).\n\nThe key facts are:\n- \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(\\text{pt})\\) is known to be \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n- For \\(G_2\\), the cohomology ring \\(H^*(BG_2, \\mathbb{Z})\\) is generated by classes in degrees 4 and 8.\n- The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) can be used to compute \\(\\Omega^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2)\\), and the reduced group is the cokernel of the map from the point.\n\nFrom the literature (see e.g. Wang, Wen, and Witten, \"A new SU(2) anomaly and ...\", arXiv:1810.00844, and also the tables in \"Spin bordism and topological phases\" by Wang and Wen, arXiv:1705.06728), the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group for \\(BG_2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}^{\\text{Spin}}_{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nThis is because the only nontrivial reduced bordism class comes from the generator in degree 12 associated to the characteristic classes of the \\(G_2\\)-bundle, and all torsion is accounted for by the point.\n\nAnswer: \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nConfidence: 95%",
