            "response": "Explanation: Critical-level views violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. This condition states that adding lives with positive welfare above a certain threshold should make a population better. Critical-level views posit that there is a critical level of welfare above zero, below which adding lives makes things worse, even if those lives are worth living. This directly conflicts with Weak Quality Addition, which holds that adding lives with positive welfare should be an improvement. The other conditions (Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, and Weak Non-Sadism) are not specifically violated by critical-level views.\n\nAnswer: E\n\nConfidence: 90%",
