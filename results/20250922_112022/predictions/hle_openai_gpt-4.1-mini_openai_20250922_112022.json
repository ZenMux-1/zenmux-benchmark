            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics outlines conditions that a critical-level utilitarian view must satisfy to avoid paradoxes or counterintuitive implications. Critical-level views typically violate the condition known as \"Non-Elitism,\" which states that the welfare of a single individual should not outweigh the welfare of many others. Critical-level views assign a baseline or \"critical level\" of welfare, and lives below this level are considered negative, which can lead to elitist implications where some lives are valued less or even negatively compared to others. This violates the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nAnswer: C. Non-Elitism  \nConfidence: 90%",

            "response": "Explanation:  \nWe want to compute the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group of the classifying space \\( BG_2 \\), denoted \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\). The \"reduced\" part means we mod out by the image of the map induced by the basepoint inclusion \\( * \\to BG_2 \\), i.e., we ignore classes coming from Spin manifolds with trivial \\(G_2\\)-bundle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- \\(\\Omega_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(X)\\) is the Spin bordism group of manifolds with a map to \\(X\\).\n- The reduced bordism \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(X)\\) is the kernel of the map \\(\\Omega_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(X) \\to \\Omega_{*}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) induced by the basepoint inclusion.\n- Here, \\(X = BG_2\\), the classifying space of the exceptional Lie group \\(G_2\\).\n\n**Step 2: Known facts**\n\n- The Spin bordism groups \\(\\Omega_*^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) are known and have no torsion in dimension 12:\n  \\[\n  \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n  generated by certain characteristic numbers (e.g., \\(\\hat{A}\\)-genus and signature-related invariants).\n  \n- The cohomology of \\(BG_2\\) with integer coefficients is known to be torsion-free and generated by classes in degrees 4 and 12:\n  \\[\n  H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[p_1, p_2]/(\\text{relations})\n  \\]\n  where \\(p_1\\) is in degree 4 and \\(p_2\\) in degree 12 (these are related to Pontryagin classes of the universal \\(G_2\\)-bundle).\n\n- The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for Spin bordism:\n  \\[\n  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) \\implies \\Omega_{p+q}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the AHSS**\n\n- Since \\(\\Omega_q^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\) is known and concentrated in degrees divisible by 4 with no torsion in low degrees, and \\(H_*(BG_2)\\) is torsion-free, the spectral sequence collapses at \\(E^2\\) modulo extension problems.\n- The reduced bordism group \\(\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2)\\) is the kernel of the map to \\(\\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\), so it corresponds to the part of the AHSS with positive homology degree \\(p > 0\\).\n\n**Step 4: Compute the relevant terms**\n\n- The terms contributing to total degree 12 are:\n  - \\(E^2_{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{8,4} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*))\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*))\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{0,12} = H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)) = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*)\\)\n\n- Since \\(\\Omega_4^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\Omega_8^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\), and \\(\\Omega_0^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\), these groups are free abelian.\n\n- The homology groups \\(H_4(BG_2)\\) and \\(H_8(BG_2)\\) are known to be free abelian of rank 1 or 0 depending on the generators. Specifically:\n  - \\(H_4(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by the first Pontryagin class \\(p_1\\).\n  - \\(H_8(BG_2) = 0\\) because the cohomology ring is generated in degrees 4 and 12, so no degree 8 classes.\n  - \\(H_{12}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) generated by \\(p_2\\).\n\n- Therefore:\n  - \\(E^2_{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{8,4} = 0\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n  - \\(E^2_{0,12} = \\Omega_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(*) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\n**Step 5: Identify the reduced group**\n\n- The reduced bordism group excludes the summand \\(E^2_{0,12}\\) corresponding to trivial bundles.\n- The remaining summands are:\n  \\[\n  E^2_{12,0} \\oplus E^2_{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^3\n  \\]\n\n- There are no differentials hitting or leaving these groups because of degree reasons and torsion-freeness.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nThe reduced Spin bordism group in dimension 12 of \\(BG_2\\) is free abelian of rank 3:\n\\[\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3\n\\]\n\n---\n\nAnswer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{\\mathrm{Spin}}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3\n}\n\\]\n\nConfidence: 90%  \nThis is based on standard computations of Spin bordism, the known cohomology of \\(BG_2\\), and the structure of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. Potential subtleties could arise from extension problems or torsion, but these are unlikely given the torsion-free nature of the input data.",
