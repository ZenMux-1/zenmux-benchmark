            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is a result in population ethics that demonstrates the difficulty of satisfying certain intuitive conditions simultaneously when evaluating population policies or moral theories. Critical-level views, which posit a threshold level of well-being below which lives are not considered to contribute positively to the overall value, are often said to violate **Weak Non-Sadism**. Weak Non-Sadism is the condition that adding individuals with lives worth living (above a certain threshold) should not make the outcome worse. Critical-level views can lead to situations where adding lives above the critical level is deemed worse, thus violating this condition.\n\nAnswer: D. Weak Non-Sadism  \nConfidence: 90%",

            "response": "To compute the reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism of the classifying space of the Lie group \\( G_2 \\), we need to consider the following:\n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. **Spin Bordism**: Spin bordism groups classify equivalence classes of Spin manifolds under bordism. For a space \\( X \\), the Spin bordism group \\( \\Omega_n^{\\text{Spin}}(X) \\) consists of equivalence classes of \\( n \\)-dimensional Spin manifolds equipped with maps to \\( X \\).\n\n2. **Classifying Space \\( BG_2 \\)**: The classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) is the space that classifies principal \\( G_2 \\)-bundles. Reduced bordism means we focus on bordism classes of Spin manifolds equipped with non-trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles.\n\n3. **Atiyah-Hirzebruch Spectral Sequence (AHSS)**: The AHSS is a tool for computing bordism groups \\( \\Omega_n^{\\text{Spin}}(X) \\) using the cohomology of \\( X \\) and the Spin bordism of a point \\( \\Omega_n^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt}) \\).\n\n4. **Structure of \\( G_2 \\)**: \\( G_2 \\) is a compact, simply-connected Lie group of dimension 14. Its classifying space \\( BG_2 \\) has cohomology generated by characteristic classes of \\( G_2 \\)-bundles.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo compute \\( \\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(BG_2) \\), we use the AHSS, which has \\( E_2 \\)-page:\n\\[\nE_2^{p,q} = H^p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt})),\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt}) \\) is the Spin bordism group of a point.\n\n#### Step 1: Spin Bordism of a Point\nThe Spin bordism groups of a point are known:\n\\[\n\\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt}) = \\begin{cases} \n\\mathbb{Z}, & q = 0, 4, 8, 12, \\dots \\\\\n\\mathbb{Z}_2, & q = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, \\dots \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Cohomology of \\( BG_2 \\)\nThe cohomology ring \\( H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is generated by characteristic classes \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\), where:\n\\[\nH^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}[p_1, p_2],\n\\]\nwith \\( \\deg(p_1) = 4 \\) and \\( \\deg(p_2) = 8 \\).\n\n#### Step 3: AHSS Differential\nThe AHSS differential \\( d_r \\) acts on \\( E_r^{p,q} \\), potentially killing some classes. For \\( BG_2 \\), the differentials are determined by the geometry of \\( G_2 \\)-bundles and the Spin structure.\n\n#### Step 4: Reduced Bordism\nReduced bordism means we exclude classes that can be represented by Spin manifolds with trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles. This focuses on classes arising from non-trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles.\n\n### Computation:\nThe reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group \\( \\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(BG_2) \\) is determined by the interaction of \\( H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) and \\( \\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt}) \\) in the AHSS. Specifically:\n- \\( \\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\), so we look for contributions from \\( H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) in degrees \\( p + q = 12 \\).\n- The relevant cohomology classes are \\( p_1^3 \\) (degree 12) and \\( p_2 \\cdot p_1 \\) (degree 12).\n\nThe reduced bordism group is generated by Spin manifolds equipped with non-trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles corresponding to these cohomology classes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe reduced 12-dimensional Spin bordism group \\( \\Omega_{12}^{\\text{Spin}}(BG_2) \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), generated by the characteristic classes \\( p_1^3 \\) and \\( p_2 \\cdot p_1 \\).\n\nExplanation: The computation uses the AHSS and the known structure of \\( H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) and \\( \\Omega_q^{\\text{Spin}}(\\text{pt}) \\). The reduced bordism focuses on non-trivial \\( G_2 \\)-bundles, leading to \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) as the result.\nAnswer: \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)\nConfidence: 90%",
