            "response": "Explanation: Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics demonstrates that no population ethic can simultaneously satisfy five intuitively plausible conditions: Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition. Critical-level views, such as critical-level utilitarianism, violate the condition of Weak Quality Addition. Weak Quality Addition states that adding a life with positive well-being should not make the population worse off; it should be at least as good as the original population. However, in critical-level utilitarianism, the value of a population is calculated as the sum of individual utilities minus a critical level multiplied by the number of people. If the critical level is positive (as is often set to avoid the repugnant conclusion), adding a life with positive well-being below this critical level (e.g., utility between 0 and the critical level) results in a decrease in the total value, making the population worse off. This directly violates Weak Quality Addition, as adding a life with positive well-being is deemed bad in such cases.\n\nAnswer: E. Weak Quality Addition\n\nConfidence: 90%",
